      "Code of Protection: Take care to watch for danger, and prepare for any occurrence. With proper protection, attacks and insults can be turned away or twisted against a foe, and others will flock to your side as they see your power.",
      "Code of Remembrance: Never forget, ever. The past is everything, and once it is lost then so are the lives and deeds of those who came before you. Thus so too will your own deeds turn to dust when you are gone if they are forgotten.",
      "Code of Trust: The highest honour you can bestow on others is to rely on them, no matter how bad things get. They will stand with you when death or worse is on the line, and you for them—without such trust, life is worthless.",
      "Code of Reliance: There are only two things you can count on in the end: yourself and the Emperor—and the Emperor expects you to take care of yourself, as She's busy. Mind yourself, and let the Emperor can take care of the rest.",
      "Code of Faith:There is more around you than prison walls and iron chains, but only those who reach out and place their fate in the Emperor's hands will ever see this. Have faith that the Emperor acts through all things, and you will be rewarded.",
      "Code of Discipline: The best way to survive is to always follow a strict internal regimen and rigidly control yourself no matter the madness around you. Only when you master yourself can you master others."

      "Walk in Footsteps: Never reveal your passage to others, for who knows what might be watching or what a wayward footfall might trigger? Ensure your feet only follow where others have stepped, especially in rough earth.",
      "Blood to Ashes: Offer life to the dead whenever possible. A few drops of blood can suffice for a minor friend or battle comrade, while a long cut to allow for both a gout and a scar of remembrance is proper for valued friends or family.",
      "Care for Yourself: Personal care is often overlooked, but is as essential as armour or filterplugs. Grooming might be mocked, but it detects diseases and ailments before they become necrotic, and also ensures you always leave a clean corpse.",
      "Watch the Skies: Death commonly comes from above, be it from xenos raiders, insectoid swarms, or avian predators. Keep your eyes always scanning upwards, and be ready to defend yourself against the lethal dangers in the air.",
      "Blink Before Seeing: True sight only comes from clear eyes, so be sure to blink at least three times whenever your vision is essential. This also wards off any biotic mites, strands of poison flora, or foul spirits that might infest your eyes.",
      "Carry the Water: There is one thing you should always have—your own water supply. This might be a small flask, an assortment of plasteel bottles, or even a conformal tank worn on the back. Forget your water, and forget tomorrow.",
      "Observe the Others: The greatest dangers can be those around you, even those you have trusted for years. Trust only goes so far, so always keep a close eye in case others turn traitor, become possessed by alien minds, or gain unnatural appetites.",
      "Sanctity of the Meal: Sustenance is essential for survival, so any opportunity to safely gather and eat together should be grasped and cherished. Every meal could be your last, so give thanks to the Emperor for both food and friendship.",
      "Paranoia is Not Enough: Anything, at any moment, could be the cause of your death. Always check your gear before travel, double-check your weaponry before combat, and triple-check your so-called allies before turning your back."

      "Share the Pain, Share the Gain: Watering the green with red shows respect for the blessed crops that feed Mankind. Always cut one's thumb before cutting a plant or chopping wood, or suffer poor digestion for a fortnight.",

      "Strength from the Dead: Even when departed to the Emperor, the fallen should aid the living. Grind a bone from the departed and add it into the next meal.",
      "Tread Lightly, Grow Brightly: Only through direct communion with the ground can luck grow in abundance. Honour the soil by walking barefoot on it before planting, or to ensure terrain acts favourably in battle.",
      "Smooth Cuttings, Strong Blessings: No scything should be unimportant. Gather and bury one's trimmed hair to promote a speedy harvest, or to smooth a comrade's passage to the Emperor's embrace.",
      "Deny the Black, Embrace the Green: Patience is rewarded at night. Those who place a plucked leaf over each eye before sleeping will see crops grow faster and voyages pass more smoothly.",
      "Close the Season, Sound the Horn: Announce every victory loudly and with pride, so the Emperor can rejoice. After the last crops are taken from a field or a hard-fought battle is won, stomp on the ground in a thunderous manner.",
      "Connect to the Land, Taller You Stand: It behooves the tillers to know their fields. Sprinkle soil taken from the first steps onto a new land into one's shoes, and only remove it when leaving."
