# Fear

The nightmarish galaxy of the 41st millennium is inimical to humanity, and Acolytes must battle against terrifying aliens, perversions of science, unholy entities from beyond the veil, and innumerable other horrors in the course of their duties\. The mere knowledge that such things exist is deathly terrifying to the average citizen of the Imperium\. In the course of their investigations, Acolytes come face\-to\-face with horrific creatures and experience terrifying events, from bloody mass sacrifices in the name of dark gods to impossible xenos monstrosities from the darkest void\. Overcoming their fear in order to fight on against such terrors can be amongst the greatest challenges Acolytes must face\. When a PC is confronted by such a frightening event or adversary, she must make a Fear test; this is a Willpower test, which is modified by how frightening the horror she faces is\. If the PC passes this test, then she continues to act as normal\. If she fails, however, she succumbs to Fear\.

## Degrees of Fear

Fear can come in many forms, but some things are clearly more frightening than others\. A horrid cult sacrifice could break the morale of a novice Acolyte, while a Bloodthirster's appearance might completely destroy her mind\. See the Fear Trait for more information

### Very Bad Things

Fear tests in non\-combat situations are very much the GM's call as to when and where they occur, and should not be considered automatic\. They can be best used to bring home the horrific nature of a scene\. The following are some guidelines for setting degrees of Fear outside of combat, and examples of situations that would cause a Fear test other than those triggered by an enemy's Fear trait:

- __Fear \(1\) Disturbing__: Viewing the scene of a gruesome murder, or seeing minor unknown supernatural or psychic phenomena—strange lights, spectral voices, weeping statues, and other unnatural occurrences\.
- __Fear \(2\) Frightening__: Meeting someone known to be dead, being buried alive, or encountering major supernatural phenomena—the skies raining blood, paintings coming to life, or flesh bursting into flame\.
- __Fear \(3\) Horrifying__: Sudden, shocking, and inexplicable death \(maggot swarms exploding out of a fellow Acolyte\), hideous moments of revelation \(awakening covered in blood, surrounded by torn open bodies\), the dead rising across a whole planet, or other mind wrenching events\.
- __Fear \(4\) Terrifying__: Experiencing a full\-scale daemonic incursion, discovering a personal failure is responsible for the wasted deaths of untold millions or an entire planet, staring unprotected into the Warp\.

## Failing the Fear Test

If a character fails a Fear test in a combat situation, she must immediately roll on the Shock Table, adding \+10 to the result for each degree of failure after the first\. The effects listed are applied immediately to the character\. At the GM's discretion, depending on the situation and the cause of the Fear, she may also assign Insanity points to characters who fail a Fear test\. If the character fails a Fear test in a non\-combat situation, she becomes unnerved and suffers a –10 penalty to any skill or test that requires concentration\. This penalty lasts while the character remains in the vicinity of the source of her Fear \(simply leaving and coming back again doesn't stop this\)\. Whenever a character fails a Fear test by 3 or more degrees of failure, she also gains 1d5 Insanity points\. In special situations or settings, the Game Master should feel free to also apply alternate or other effects, such as levels of Fatigue\.

### Shock
__Roll__|__Result__
-------|--------
01–20  |The character is badly startled. She can only take a single Half Action during her next turn, but afterward she acts normally.
21–40  |Fear grips the character and she begins to shake and tremble. She suffers a –10 penalty on all tests for the rest of the encounter unless she can Snap Out of It (Willpower test in her next turn).
41–60  |Reeling with shock, the character backs away from the source of her Fear. She cannot willingly approach the object of her Fear, but can otherwise act normally, with a –10 penalty on all tests until the end of the encounter.
61–80  |The character is frozen by terror. She can take no actions until she can Snap Out of It (Willpower test in her next turn). After snapping out of it, she makes all tests with a –10 penalty for the rest of the encounter.
81–100 |Panic grips the character. She must flee the source of her fear, if able, as fast as she can, and if prevented from doing so, can only take Half Actions and is at a –20 penalty to all tests. Once away from the danger, she must successfully Snap Out of It (Willpower test in her next turn) to regain control.
101–120|Fainting dead away, the character keels over and remains Unconscious for 1d5 rounds. Once she regains consciousness, she is still shaken and takes all tests with a –10 penalty until the end of the encounter.
121–130|Totally overcome, the character screams and vomits uncontrollably for 1d5 rounds. During this time she can do nothing, and drops anything she is holding. Afterward, until the end of the encounter, the character can only take a single Half Action each turn.
131–140|The character laughs hysterically and randomly attacks anything near her in a manic frenzy, firing wildly or attacking with whatever she has at hand. This effect lasts until the character Snaps Out of It (Willpower test in her next turn), or until she is knocked Unconscious or otherwise incapacitated.
141–160|The character crumples to the ground for 1d5+1 rounds and begins sobbing, babbling, and tearing at her own flesh, and can do nothing else. Even after she returns to her senses, she is a complete mess, and suffers a –20 penalty on all tests until the end of the encounter.
161–170|The character's mind snaps. She becomes catatonic for 1d5 hours; for that time, she is Unconscious and cannot be roused.
171+   |The character is so overcome with terror that her heart stops: she must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness test or die. If she succeeds, the character still falls Unconscious for 1d5 hours, and cannot be roused for that time.

### Shock and Snapping Out of It

Characters can try to shake off some of the effects of Fear after the initial shock has worn off\. When specified in a Shock result that a character can “snap out of it”, she makes a Willpower test in her next turn\. If successful, she regains her senses, shrugs off the effects, and can act normally\. If she fails, the effect continues and the character can try to snap out of it again in the following turn, and so on\.
