†_Note in the case of Tech-Use, characters cannot create items they do not have access to designs for._

It is possible—with the right skills and materials—for a character to create his own items: crafting basic gear and equipment like spears or storm-cloaks, brewing up herbal remedies and advanced drugs and medicines, or building advanced weapons and works of art. To create an item, a character needs three things: the right skill, materials, and time.

## Crafting skills

There are five different kinds of crafting skills, each one covering the creation of different kinds of items.

### Linguistics

This skill allows a character to to compose moving, informative, and influential works of prose and poetry in the languages in which they are trained.

### Medicae

This skill allows a character to create all manner of drugs and poisons. With the GM's permission, players can even create new drugs and poisons based on the venom of slain creatures or to mimic the effects of certain environments (note that here a character always needs at least a small sample of the original substance).

### Survival

This skill allows a character to create any kind of basic device or basic item such as clothing or foodstuffs. Survival can be used to craft any item with the Primitive special quality or any Low-tech Weapon. With the GM's permission, players can also create any simple item with this skill, provided it can be fashioned from unprocessed materials and lacks any complex moving parts (i.e., clothing, a cart, a hovel, etc.).

### Tech-Use

This skill allows a character to create complex or technical devices such as those commonly created within the forges of Imperial worlds. With the GM's permission, any weapon, armour, explosive, or piece of tech can be created using this skill. Unlike things made with Survival and Medicae, however, many items created using this skill are fiendishly complex, or their designs a closely guarded secret, and are only available to characters with the right knowledge and access to advanced workshops.

### Trade

This skill allows a character to manufacture things, from inspiring sculpture to mighty starships. What can be created depends on the speciality. Like items made with Tech-Use, these often require advanced workshops and specialised materials. Trade crafting often involves fashioning new, unique items of personal design, and thus do not always require detailed plans for the item. Major projects, such as vehicles or huge statuary, should require large amounts of time, with the GM altering the Time listings from hours to days or even months and longer.

## Materials

When creating an item, a character must first have access to the right materials. Whether these materials are on hand is up to the GM, though common sense should play a part (i.e., a character on a feral world is going to have access to many basic materials good for the Survival skill, but might have trouble finding the parts needed to make an autogun). Once it has been determined whether the materials are on hand, the GM then decides if the character needs to expend any resources acquiring them. As a general rule, when creating items using the Tech-Use skill (or the Medicae skill when creating advanced drugs, such as those not occurring naturally), characters must always buy materials. Items crafted with Survival, on the other hand, can other be made from "found" materials, such as fashioning a bow when in a forest, or making a spear from scrap metal in an underhive.

When acquiring materials for crafting, determine the item's Availability and then decrease it by one level (i.e., Average items become Common, Common items become Plentiful, etc.). The character then makes a Requisition test to acquire the materials just as if he were acquiring an item. Once he has the materials, he can then try to create the item.

## Time

Creating an item takes time and is always an Extended test set by the GM. The length of the test and the time it takes depends on the complexity of the item. While both these factors are up to the GM, he can use Table: Crafting Items as a guideline. The Game Master can also modify Crafting tests depending on factors such as the presence of assistants, the workshop or lab available, the levels of funding or materials available, and the quality of each. The Time listed in Table: Crafting Items are meant to represent the amount of time spent during each individual skill test, not the entire time taken to create the item.

## Fruits of your Labour

In most cases, what the character gets out of crafting an item is obvious, its the new sword or lasgun or batch of drugs that they just spent all that time on. In other cases, such as the works of art produced by the Trade or Linguistics skills, its less obvious. For these works, the typical end goal is for them to be appreciated by the masses, or to appeal to a wealthy patron. At the GM's discretion, the artists may gain 1, or more for particularly good results, Influence, to represent their name spreading, or the eye of an appreciative noble upon them.
