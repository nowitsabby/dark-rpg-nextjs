      "description": "Acrobatics covers feats of agile movement, graceful motion, and mastery of balance and form. With this skill, characters can leap nimbly across gaping chasms, maintain their balance on a pitching ship deck, or fall gracefully to the ground without snapping their limbs. In combat, an accomplished acrobat can somersault, flip, or cartwheel away from foes, twisting her body out of reach of her enemy or slipping past foes in a blur of motion. Often, characters develop a knack for Acrobatics as part of their training in another field. A courier or thief might learn these knacks as part of travel through densely populated areas. Gladiators, survivalists, and dancers need to be able to perform acrobatic motions as part of their daily routines. Even a Tech- Adept accustomed to working in particularly confined quarters devotes her daily flesh-exhortations to improving flexibility, so that she might more effectively work within narrow ductwork.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Acrobatics skill when: \n\n* She must keep her balance or avoid falling in unstable ground. \n\n* She wishes to jump down from a height and land well. \n\n* She wants to move over or around a foe or obstacle in her path without breaking her stride.",

As a Full Action, a character may make an Acrobatics skill test to free herself from bonds, such as rope, manacles, or the like. This test can only be attempted once to escape restraints; if the character fails to free herself the first time, then she is simply too tightly bound and unable to contort her way free. The GM can modify this test depending on the quality of the bonds in this situation. Characters may also use Acrobatics to escape from a grapple by using their Acrobatics skill instead of their Agility or Strength when grappling.",
        "__Jumping:__ A well-trained acrobat excels at jumping, leaping, and lessening the effect of falls by folding her body as she hits the ground. When jumping or leaping, a character may use the Acrobatics skill in the place of Agility and Strength tests. When determining Falling damage, a character can make an Acrobatics skill test to reduce the effective distance fallen by a number of metres equal to her Agility bonus.",

      "description": "Characters are often dependent upon their physical abilities, particularly when situations become violent. Athletics measures a character's ability to run long distances without tiring, climb sheer surfaces, and lift heavy loads. It also allows a character to push herself to greater levels of endurance and shrug off the effects of fatigue when running, swimming, or climbing. A character's background might dispose her more towards certain types of athletics. A GM can keep this in mind when determining the difficulty of a test. For example, a character from a desert world or could be required to make more difficult Athletics tests to swim across a river than someone who grew up on an aquatic agri-world would.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Athletics skill when: \n\n* She must swim across a body of water or try to stay afloat. \n\n* She wishes to push herself beyond her limits and keep going even when exhausted. \n\n* She wants to climb a cliff or cross extremely rough ground.",

As a Free Action, a character with the Athletics skill can make a Difficult (-10) Athletics skill test whenever she suffers a level of Fatigue as a result of running, swimming, or climbing to ignore its effects. The character can continue to take tests and ignore Fatigue gained in this way indefinitely; however, as soon as she fails a test, she must rest for at least 4 hours and cannot use her Athletics skill again during that time.",
        "__Heft:__ Athletes are also known for their strength and can lift great weights for short periods of time. As a Free Action, a character can make a Challenging (+0) Athletics skill test to increase her carrying capability for a single encounter. For every degree of success the character achieves, her Strength is increased by 10 for the purposes of how much weight she can carry, lift, or drag, to a maximum modified Strength of 100. Hefting can only be attempted once, and if the character fails the test, she cannot try again until the next encounter."

      "description": "Awareness represents the character's general awareness of her surroundings and the ability to notice inconsistencies that others might dismiss. It encompasses a basic alertness to any changes that might be detected by the senses, including visual cues, sounds, odours, and even air pressure. A highly-trained observer is just as capable of noticing and identifying the presence of a new factor as they are the absence of a common one. Threats to the Mankind can lurk in the shadows of any location, and often the subtlest of cues can reveal far deeper meanings. In general, Awareness is used when trying to spot items or individuals that are either hidden or not easy to notice. Scrutiny is used to interpret hidden emotions, motivations, or other undercurrents. So while spotting someone hidden would be Awareness, determining whether someone is lying or being deceitful would be Scrutiny. When Awareness is used against an opponent (such as to spot an ambush) it is an Opposed test. Awareness opposes and is opposed by Stealth.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Awareness skill when: \n\n* She is walking into an ambush or being spied upon by a hidden foe. \n\n* She wants to search an area for clues or find a hidden item. \n\n* She is trying to eavesdrop on a conversation or there is a chance of overhearing some pertinent information.",

        "__Lip Reading:__ Lip reading allows an Acolyte to effectively understand a conversation even though she cannot hear it. The character must have a clear view of the speaker's mouth and understand the language used by the target. The difficulty of this test is modified -10 for every 10 metres of distance between the character and the speaker. The GM can assign other penalties for darkness, fog, or other factors affecting vision; magnoculars or other vision enhancing devices can help offset this penalty or provide a bonus. A successful Awareness skill test reveals the general gist of the conversation, such as talking about a drop point or the location of a cult gathering. Additional degrees of success reveal correspondingly more information. The character need not make a skill test every round, as one degree of success is enough to follow the conversation for the span of roughly one topic. The GM determines when a new test is necessary.",
        "__Gambling:__ A character can use a variety of skills when participating in games of chance rather than simply relying on blind luck. In a typical game, each participant wagers an amount, though these are typically the same, and makes one or more Opposed tests. The character with the most degrees of success or fewest degrees of failure wins the pot. If the character is attempting to win by playing the game at its basic level— analysing the odds and playing intelligently, each participant uses Logic. However, Gamblers often use bluffing, deception, and outright cheating in order to win. In this case, Deceive might be used to bluff or trick an opponent, while Sleight of Hand could be used to palm cards or alter results. These would be opposed by Scrutiny and Awareness, respectively."

      "description": "Charm is a measure of a character's knack for impressing people and swaying their reactions. The acting character's attitude is key in distinguishing between this and other types of Interaction skills. Charm requires the Acolyte to assume a non-hostile attitude and not make any explicit or implicit threats. Instead, the character's persuasive efforts are dependent upon perceived generosity and good intentions. Such an approach may be completely foreign to some Acolytes, who find persuasion more appealing when matched with force or logic. Others, particularly those who come from luxury or who are masters of manipulation, might use this as their favoured approach to all problems. Often, bonuses or penalties can result from a character's appearance and style of dress. Refer to Narrative Tools for more information on social interaction. When Charm is used against an opponent (such as to change her mood) it is an Opposed test. Charm is opposed by Willpower.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Charm skill when: \n\n* She wants to make someone like her for whatever reason. \n\n* She wishes to distract someone by drawing her focus away from others. \n\n* She is gathering information from locals or strangers.",

Under these circumstances, characters may need to rally a much larger group to assist. Coordinating their allies so that everyone can work together effectively relies upon the Command skill. It represents the ability to effectively motivate and organise others. Characters with a noble background might have some training in this skill. Those with military service are of course practiced with it; even those who have only been given commands are very familiar with the practice and can issue them as well. Other characters might have learned it as a bureaucratic manager or a tribal leader. In contrast, characters accustomed to working independently could have little aptitude for commanding (or being commanded by) others.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Command skill when: \n\n* She wishes to send an NPC ally into an extremely dangerous situation or into open combat. \n\n* She needs to rally her allied fighting forces or organise them in the face of a surprise attack.",

The character makes a Command skill test opposed by the Willpower of the Fear-causing creature. Both the character and the creature add +10 to their rolls for each level of Fear they possess.

Few, if any, planets could hope to survive on their own for more than a few months without external support. Forge worlds need food and raw materials from other systems, agri-worlds can seldom produce the machinery required for their harvests, and hive worlds are often so densely occupied that their only local product is the world's population. The Commerce skill represents the understanding of trade, value, and exchange, which allows these worlds to continue to exist at a planetary level, and also more locally at a habway marketplace. Many within the Imperium's vast bureaucracy, and even its military, learn this skill. All humans must practise it to a certain degree, as they acquire the basic necessities for life. Ultimately, thieves and merchants are the most adept, as they must know the value of any goods they plan to steal or sell. When Commerce is used against an opponent (such as to gain a bonus on a Requisition test) it is always an Opposed test. Commerce opposes, and is opposed by, either Commerce or Willpower.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Commerce skill when: \n\n* She wants to gain a bonus when attempting a Requisition test. \n\n* She wishes to track down a rare item in a hive market. \n\n* She wants to know how much an item is worth.",

Perpetrators are seldom cooperative, unless they believe that there might be some reward for their service. No matter the motive or the target, all of these untruths are spoken in the service of the Emperor. Deceive measures a character's aptitude for fooling others into believing something that is not true. All who serve an Inquisitor must have some ability in this field, but some become far more specialised in their deceptions. Of course, a Deceive test is only required if the acting character believes she is lying. Relating inaccurate information that the Acolyte believes is true uses the appropriate skill for the situation.

The time taken depends greatly on the complexity of the disguise; simply putting on an enemy's uniform or covering the one's face with filth may take minutes, while trying to disguise gender or mimic a specific individual may take hours, days, or longer. The GM decides how long formulating a disguise takes and if the character has the materials at hand. Once the disguise is donned, the GM then secretly tests for the player (using her Deceive skill and any appropriate modifiers) whenever the disguise comes under scrutiny (an Opposed test against the Scrutiny of whoever is trying to see through the disguise).

Talents determine the languages a specific character knows, such as the Low Gothic of the masses, a feral world's regional dialect, or even a xenos tongue. When attempting to use a language the character knows, a Linguistics test is only required for a particularly difficult task, such as translating an ancient version of the language or attempting to understand a garbled vox-intercept. Unknown languages, however, always require a Linguistics test to understand on even a basic level. A character might need to speak with a human from a rediscovered world that was forgotten for millennia, or a researcher may need to comprehend a xenos prophecy that predates the Great Crusade.\n\nCommunicating with those whose language is foreign depends upon a character's knowledge and aptitude in the Linguistics skill. Two key factors play into determining the difficulty for a Linguistics test.\n\nThe first is the complexity of the message; simple greetings or warnings are far easier to interpret than more complex philosophical or religious concepts. Such communications might not necessitate a test, even if the message is delivered in an entirely foreign tongue. The second difficulty factor is a measure of how foreign the language is to any the character knows. If the communication arrives in a strange or archaic dialect of the character's native tongue, then translation could be challenging, but feasible. Conversely, if the message is in a language that a xenos race developed in an entirely different part of the galaxy, deciphering it without additional context might be impossible.\n\nAny character who has this a skill knows how to read and write in her primary language. For most of the Imperium, this is Low Gothic. Note that all Acolytes are capable of basic communication in Low Gothic that would not require a skill test, such as normal conversation or reading standard Munitorum manuals.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Linguistics skill when: \n\n* She must decipher an archaic version of her language. \n\n* She wishes to compose a moving piece of prose. \n\n* She is trying to convey a message using subtle subtext or a limited vocabulary.",

Note that this does not include an understanding of complex theories or the terminology involved with them—that would fall more commonly under Scholastic Lore.

In many instances, a character's ability to comprehend logical phenomena might be impeded by her belief systems, including her faith in the Imperial Creed or the Omnissiah. Characters who frequently need to identify or resolve complex situations can hone this skill through frequent use. The variables involved in any problem determine the inherent difficulty of a Logic test.

If there are too many unknown factors, the problem might only be solved after uncovering additional clues, or through prodigious luck.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Logic skill when:\n\n* She must solve a riddle or puzzle.\n\n* She is looking for clues in a vast amount of seemingly unrelated information.\n\n* She is trying to win at a game of chance.",

If the character is attempting to win by playing the game at its basic level— analysing the odds and playing intelligently, each participant uses Logic. However, Gamblers often use bluffing, deception, and outright cheating in order to win.

      "description": "The Operate skill represents a character's aptitude to control and direct all manner of vehicles and heavy equipment. Through the remarkable consistency of Standard Template Construction, the control systems used to operate dramatically different vehicles are extremely similar. In many instances, this may be due to an interaction between the vehicle's machine spirit and the controlled systems used to direct the craft. In other cases, this is due to a simplification or approximation of controls, intended to reduce the effort required to learn to operate the vehicle. All characters who come from worlds with any degree of technology learn the basics of operation. Essentially, the need to control a craft of some sort is largely unavoidable. However, familiarity with a basic civilian autocarriage is scarcely adequate preparation for the nuanced art of flying an Imperial Valkyrie or firing a heavy macrobattery at an enemy voidship. A character with the Operate skill is adept at piloting, driving, or operating a particular type of vehicle or machine. No test is normally required to pilot or drive a vehicle unless it is in a combat situation or other unusual circumstances such as extremely rough terrain or high speeds. \n\nOperate (Surface) covers the ability to pilot any vehicle that primarily operates on the surface of a planet. Ground cars, walkers, treaded vehicles, boats, and skimmers (hovering or flying vehicles that must remain very low to the ground) can all be piloted using Operate (Surface). \n\nThe Game Master can call on a player to use the Operate (Surface) skill when: \n\n* She is driving a vehicle in a combat situation. \n\n* She wishes to push her vehicle beyond its normal limits. \n\n* She is attempting to manoeuvre her bike through a crowded habway filled with civilians. \n\nOperate (Aeronautica) covers the ability to pilot any vehicle that operates in three dimensions. This primarily covers atmospheric fliers such as the Imperial Navy Thunderbolt or Chaos Hellblade, but also includes small, manoeuvrable voidcraft such as landers, shuttles, starfighters, and bombers. Piloting jump packs that provide limited air mobility is also covered by this ability.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Operate (Aeronautica) skill when: \n\n* She is piloting a vehicle in a combat situation. \n\n* She wishes to fly her vehicle beyond its normal safe altitude. \n\n* She is trying to land an damaged Arvus Lighter in the midst of a meteor shower. \n\nOperate (Voidship) covers the ability to pilot large void-faring vessels that are often kilometres long and millennia old. Any space going vessel that requires a captain and large crew, and cannot be conceivably piloted by a single individual, is operated with this skill. \n\nThe Game Master can call on a player to use the Operate (Voidship) skill when: \n\n* She is manoeuvring a voidship. \n\n* She is overseeing the use of a macrobattery, orbital laser, or some other massive ship's weapon.",

Characters can use the skill to detect the presence or absence of Daemons and the use of psychic powers. Psyniscience also allows detection of psychic phenomena, disturbances, voids, or other areas where the flow of the Immaterium has been unsettled or disrupted. The difficulty for a Psyniscience test is based upon the potency of any nearby Warp activity. In general, the more powerful the activity, the easier it may be to sense. At the same time, by attempting to identify such a presence, a character must temporarily open her mind to its influence. Particularly potent threats may be able to seize this opportunity, and react aggressively to the probe. While subtler activity is far less dangerous to the acting character, it is also far more difficult to sense. To purchase this skill, the character must have a special ability stating she has access to it (such as the Psyker trait), reflecting her attunement to the Warp. Unless otherwise noted, she can use the Psyniscience skill to detect entities, locales, and events up to a number of kilometres away equal to her Perception bonus. The GM can, though, alter this range depending on the situation. A character who is not a psyker can also use this skill, representing her ability to recognise the subtle phenomena, such as strange patterns of dust motes or odd sensory distortions, which often accompany psychic disturbances. Additional degrees of success provide more information about the Warp activity. \n\nOne DoS: Awareness of Immaterium disruption or number of entities present.\n\nTwo DoS: Approximate direction of the Warp phenomena or creatures.\n\nThree DoS: Rough location of the Warp creatures or beings affecting the Immaterium.\n\nFour+ DoS: Exact position of the unnatural creatures or psykers present. \n\\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Psyniscience skill when: \n\n* She is hunting for the location of a Daemon. \n\n* She wishes to determine whether a psyker has used her powers recently in the area. \n\n* She is trying to find a weak point between realspace and the Immaterium.",

Both taming and training beasts are Extended tests, the duration of which is determined by the nature and temperament of the creature involved. Once an animal has been broken to its master's will—or at least formed a partnership, for particularly strong-willed beasts—directing it or issuing commands is a Half Action. Wild animals, or those trained for hostility and aggression, can have their Disposition improved by 10 for every two degrees of success (up to a maximum of three levels) by a Full Action use of this skill. GMs should impose modifiers for animals that have been particularly well-trained or those with strong Willpower and Intelligence. Wrangling is of no use against cyber or psy-bonded animals, nor against any creatures with true sentience."

      "description": "Tech-Use is a measure of an Acolyte's ability to use and interact with all manner of technological devices, from proper implementation of the Rites of Striking to the temperatures of holy lubricants a machine spirit finds most soothing. It can also be used to build basic or complex technical devices with the right amount of time and materials. Tech-Use is more an understanding of the Blessings of the Omnissiah and the rites of the Machine Cult than it is an actual knowledge of the science behind technology—in the 41st Millennium, however, this amounts to the same thing. The difficulty for this skill use is related to the complexity of the device and its design nature. A simple tool of Eldar origin, for example, might be every bit as dangerous as a venting plasma gun to the uninitiated. Conversely, no amount of familiarity with the blessed design principles of a Warp engine can make it an easily understood device.\n\nThe GM can call on a player to use the Tech-Use skill when: \n\n* She wants to repair a broken weapon or vehicle. \n\n* She wishes to push a piece of technology beyond its normal capabilities or operating parameters. \n\n* She is trying to determine how a piece of unknown or unfamiliar technology works",

        "__Crafting:__ Tech-Use can be used to make all kinds of technical devices, from simple clockwork and steam engines to advanced weaponry and armour. The time, difficulty, and materials it takes to create these items are greatly dependent on their complexity, the kind of workshop the character has, and her access to properly sanctified designs or Adeptus Mechanicus data-vaults. See Crafting for the kinds of things that can be created using Tech-Use. ",
        "__Demolitions:__ Tech-Use can be used to determine the effectiveness of explosive devices, which is greatly dependent upon the skill with which they are placed. Success on a Tech-Use skill test indicates a character has successfully planted an explosive charge, and set it with the trigger of her choice. Possible triggers are only limited by a character's imagination, and can include trip wires, timers, proximity sensors, or remote activators. Failure indicates that the explosives fail to go off when triggered, though the character does not know this until the time of activation. In some situations, the GM might desire withhold this information or even give false results based on the degrees of failure. Four or more degrees of failure indicate the character has set the device off prematurely and it explodes while being set!\n\nSome tasks, such as rigging a building for demolition or bringing down a massive suspension bridge, require an Extended test. The GM should set the difficulty and duration depending on the extent of the undertaking. When placing explosives, make sure to note the total degrees of success and the die roll, as it might be used in an Opposed test if someone attempts to defuse a character's hard work. Defusing charges also falls under the Tech-Use skill, with an Opposed test against the Tech-Use skill test of the individual who set the explosives. Winning the test indicates that the bomb has been defused. Simple failure means that while the charge has not been disarmed, neither has it gone off. Four or more degrees of failure indicate the character has set off the device, suffering the consequences of the explosion. Defusing multiple charges or complex trigger mechanisms might require an Extended test, as determined by the GM."
