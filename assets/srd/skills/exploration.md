# Exploration

Rogue Trader is a story-driven game that involves lots of travel, exploration, and hopefully, the acquisition of wealth. This section explains additional rules for conducting the business of a Rogue Trader organisation — to venture into the unknown, explore, exploit, and conquer. There are two main groups of Skills characters are likely to rely on heavily during their travels, Exploration Skills and Investigation Skills. Both groups provide many interesting opportunities for individuals to grab a few moments in the spotlight. However, Skill Tests should not be used to replace roleplaying—instead they should be used to augment roleplaying and encourage total group participation.

## Using Exploration Skills

Exploration Skills can help achieve a multitude of objectives, from prowling the remains of a derelict space hulk in search of ancient technology to surveying a planetary surface for rich mineral veins. Exploration Skills differ from Investigation Skills in that Exploration Skills tend to focus on searching or examining locations in order to find out what is there.

## Exploration Challenges

| Challenge Complexity | Degrees of Success Needed |
| --- | --- |
| **Simple** | 3 |
| **Taxing** | 6 |
| **Involved** | 12 |

When a group of characters wishes to apply their collective specialities to an exploration task, the GM can create an Exploration Challenge. This is simply an expanded version of a Skill Test where multiple characters can attempt to contribute to the success of the challenge over an extended period of time. To create an Exploration Challenge, the GM considers the nature and overall complexity of the challenge and assigns a total number of degrees of success necessary to complete the challenge. Table Exploration Challenges provides some example guidelines. 

During an Exploration Challenge, each participating character can make a Skill Test using any Exploration Skill he possesses, though the GM may rule that certain Skills provide no meaningful help to task at hand. The same character can make multiple tests, but each time he must chose a different Exploration Skill. Likewise, the same Exploration Skill can be tested multiple times, but only if it is attempted by a different character each time. It is up to the players to decide the order of the Exploration Skill Tests. The default difficulty of each individual Exploration Skill Test is Challenging (+0), but this can change depending on the outcome of previous tests made in the challenge. 

On a success, the difficulty of the next Exploration Skill Test has its difficulty reduced by one step. Furthermore, each degree of success contributes an equal number of degrees of success toward completing the Exploration Challenge. Conversely, a failure on an individual Exploration Skill Test increases the difficulty of the next Exploration Skill Test by one step. Furthermore, for each degree of failure remove one degree of success toward completing the Exploration Challenge. Explorers can use Fate Points to affect the outcome of Exploration Challenges if they wish.

### Failing an Exploration Challenge

If the explorers collectively test all of their Exploration Skills without accumulating enough degrees of success to complete the Exploration Challenge, they fail the challenge and are delayed. The exact consequences of such a delay are largely up to the GM, but the explorers should never be faced with a permanent, insurmountable failure. Instead, the explorers could be forced to return their ship or base of operations and formulate a new strategy, or they could be temporarily stuck in a dangerous environment where their very survival is at stake. Whatever the consequences, the GM should eventually give them another chance to tackle the Exploration Challenge.
