        "description": "The Warrant of Trade is the instrument by which a Rogue Trader is granted her lofty position and the method by which she exercises her considerable powers. Warrants are granted on the highest of authorities, usually by the office of the High Lords of Terra themselvesâ€”and by extension, the Emperor. The issuing of a Warrant is an occasion of great significance, marked by extravagant pomp and ceremony, for it marks the establishment of a new noble line that, should the recipient prove successful, might conquer and rule entire regions of space in the name of the Imperium, thus expanding Mankind's domains. Warrants are issued for many reasons. Some are granted in recognition of a great service done to the Imperium, while others are created for entirely political ends. Rogue Trader Warrants are hereditary. Once one is issued, it will be passed down from one generation to the next, at least for as long as there are heirs extant to receive it. Many Rogue Trader lines die out and yet more are created to replace them, ensuring a constant supply of individuals driven to expand the Imperium's holdings. New lines are created as a reward for military service, as a tool for political purposes, self-rewarded by the powerful, or as a means of virtual exile for those with powerful enemies."

The Rogue Trader's Exceptional Leader ability may be used once per Strategic Turn in Space Combat, provided that they can both see and hear the Rogue Trader. Typically, this means they must be in the same location aboard the ship (such as the bridge). The Rogue Trader may not give himself the bonus from Exceptional Leader."
