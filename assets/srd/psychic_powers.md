# Psykers

Psykers are beings with the ability to manipulate the power of the Immaterium, bending the chaotic energy to their will to manifest potent psychic powers. Characters can become psykers by taking the Psyker elite advance. This grants them the ability to purchase psychic powers with experience points, and gives them access to a new resource: psy rating. Over the course of their adventures, warbands can encounter other beings that manifest powers using Warp energies. In all cases, the GM and players should use the rules presented here to represent a psyker's deadly gifts.

## Psy Ratings

Psy rating (PR) is a raw measure of a psyker's power and his ability to draw power from the Warp. The higher a psyker's PR, the more powerful he will be. PR usually ranges from 1 (an untrained Imperial psyker or petty Warp-witch) to 10 (a monstrous Greater Daemon of Tzeentch or masterful Eldar Farseer), though in some extremely special cases it might go higher still. PR is used to determine the potency of all psychic powers, such as range, area effect, or damage. To have any access to psychic powers, a character must have a PR of at least 1.

### Psy Rating Advances

A starting psyker has a psy rating of 1. Unlike other characteristics, however, psy rating is increased by spending experience points in a similar manner to gaining talents. Increasing a character's psy rating represents that character unlocking additional psychic potential, and becoming more and more powerful. The farther along a psyker progresses, the harder it becomes for him to strain his limits and grow in power, however. To increase his psy rating, the Acolyte spends experience points equal to 200x the psy rating to which he wishes to advance. So, if a psyker with a psy rating of 2 wants to increase his psy rating to 3, he must pay 3 x 200 xp, a total of 600 experience points. An Acolyte can advance his psy rating multiple times. Each time this is done, his psy rating increases by 1, to a maximum of 10. Note that an increase in psy rating does not provide additional psychic powers, only more control over them.

## Psychic Disciplines

Psychic powers are divided into different disciplines, based on how they use the energies of the Warp. Each discipline corresponds to a tree that determines its availability to a character.

## Using Psychic Powers

When a psyker, such as Sanctioned Psyker, wishes to use a psychic power, he must first choose how much power he is pouring into the ability, and any other methods he is using to draw upon and focus the power of the Warp. Then he must make a Focus Power Test (typically, but not always, a Willpower Test, modified by the difficulty of the power and the character's effective Psy Rating), to see if it manifests. Finally, if the Test is successful, the power will take effect. Depending on how much energy the psyker used and what methods he used to bolster his efforts, there may be additional consequences. The step-by-step process for using a psychic power is described below:

#### Choose the power level (Fettered, Unfettered or Push)

The power level at which the psyker uses his power (reflecting how deeply he is drawing from the Warp) influences the likelihood of the psyker successfully manifesting the power, and also determines whether there are any unwanted side effects such as Psychic Phenomena.

#### Make a Focus Power Test

In most cases, this is a Willpower Test (though there are some exceptions), the difficulty of which depends on the power, and which is modified further based on the power level chosen. In some cases, determined by the specific power, the target may Oppose this Test.

#### Apply the Effects

Depending on the psyker's final Psy Rating (as determined by the power level he has chosen), the power will have variable effects, such as increased range, area of effect, or Damage. Depending on the factors described above, the power may also generate Psychic Phenomena or even Perils of the Warp.

### Psychic Strength

Whenever a psyker uses a power, he is drawing energy from the Warp and channelling it into physical effects. However, opening such a conduit to the Warp is always dangerous, and the psyker incurs a chance of causing disturbances in the Warp that have undesired side-effects. In extreme cases, these disturbances may even lead to the opening of an uncontrolled rift between reality and the Warp, with potentially fatal consequences. By minimising the amount of power he draws, a psyker can reduce or eliminate the chances of side-effects such as Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp.

Alternatively, he can draw deeper from the well of the Warp to boost his powers beyond his normal capabilities. Of course, such power always comes with greater risk of unleashing unintended effects or even summoning unwanted visitors from beyond. The precise effects of Psychic Phenomena vary based on the nature of the psyker: The Sanctioned Psykers of the Imperium, the Librarians of the Space Marines, and the traitorous Sorcerers of the Chaos Space Marines draw on less power but may use it more safely, while unsanctioned witches and mortal wyrds are subject to harsher effects, but can draw more deeply in return, and those who are not mortal (that is, those with the Daemonic Trait) remain largely unperturbed by such trivial fluctuations of the Warp, and suffer far less severe effects. These varying effects are described on Table Psychic Strength.

| Class of Psyker | Fettered (Psy Rating/2) | Unfettered (Psy Rating) | Push (Psy Rating +1 to +3/+4/+5) | Sustaining Powers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Bound: Sanctioned Psykers and Astropaths, Librarians, and Chaos Space Marines | Make a Focus Power Test, counting Psy Rating as half normal. No chance to manifest Psychic Phenomena. | If the psyker rolls doubles during a Focus Power Test, roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table. |  May add up to +3 to Psy Rating when Pushing. Roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table, adding +10 to the total. | +10 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena Table, decrease Psy Rating by 1 per power. |
| Unbound: Wyrds, renegade psykers and mortal sorcerers | Make a Focus Power Test, counting Psy Rating as half normal. No chance to manifest Psychic Phenomena. | If the psyker rolls doubles during a Focus Power Test, roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table, adding +10 to the total. | May add up to +5 to Psy Rating. Roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table at +5 per +1 PR added, up to a maximum of +25. | +10 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena Table, decrease Psy Rating by 1 per power. |
| Daemonic: psychic daemons, Daemonhosts, and daemon princes | May not use powers at the Fettered level. | If the psyker rolls doubles during a Focus Power Test, roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table, adding +10 to the total. The psyker is not affected by the result unless the result causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him may be. | May add up to +4 to Psy Rating. Roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table at +10 per +1 PR added, up to a maximum of +40. The psyker is not affected by the result unless the result causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him may be. | +10 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena Table, decrease Psy Rating by 1 per power. The psyker is not affected by the result unless the result causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him may be. |


When a psyker uses a power, he has a choice of using it at one of three different levels:

#### Fettered

The psyker holds back his full power and carefully channels energy from the Warp, hopefully using just enough to manifest the power but not enough to trigger unnatural or dangerous effects. When any psyker uses a power at the Fettered level, he must make a Focus Power Test (see below) to manifest the power. The limited power involved means that the psyker must halve his PR (rounding up) when determining the bonus applied to the Focus Power Test and any effects the power has. However, regardless of the results of the Focus Power Test, there is no risk of triggering Psychic Phenomena.

#### Unfettered

The psyker puts the full weight of his ability into the power and embraces the raging powers of the Warp. When a Psyker uses a power at the Unfettered level, he must make a Focus Power Test (see below) to manifest the power. As he is using his full natural ability, he uses his full PR when determining the bonus applied to his Focus Power Test and any effects the power has. However, should he roll a double (that is, both the tens dice and the units dice come up with the same number), he will suffer from an unexpected surge in the Warp and must roll on Table Psychic Phenomena. Note that it is possible for a psyker to successfully pass his Focus Power Test (thus successfully activating the power) and still suffer Psychic Phenomena.

#### Push

The psyker draws deeply and greedily from the Warp, and hurls as much power forth as he possibly can in an attempt to manifest truly wondrous and terrifying effects. When using a power at the Push level, he must make a Focus Power Test (see below) to manifest the power. As the psyker is drawing deeply and recklessly from the Warp, he may add +1 to +3 (or more depending on the type of the psyker; this is detailed on Table Psychic Strength) to his Psy Rating when determining the bonus applied to his Focus Power Test and any effects the power has. However, regardless of the Test's result, the psyker will automatically generate a significant disturbance in the Warp and must roll on Table Psychic Phenomena and modify the result depending on the psyker's nature as described in Table Psychic Strength. Additionally, Pushing a power is taxing—if a psyker using this level of power rolls a double on his Focus Power Tests, he suffers a level of Fatigue from the effort.

### Focus Power Test

Any use of a psychic power begins with a Focus Power Action, which requires a Focus Power Test to determine whether or not the power manifests successfully, and how potent its effects are. The amount of time this action takes is determined by the power being used, and may be a Free Action, Half Action, Full Action, or Reaction. In most cases, a Focus Power Test is a Willpower Test, modified by the difficulty of the power being used, and the Psy Rating of the psyker, which grants a +5 bonus to the Test for every point of Psy Rating the psyker uses for that power. If this Test is passed, the power has manifested, while failing the Test means that the power does not manifest and nothing happens, though the Action is still used regardless of whether the power takes effect. A result of 91 or higher always indicates failure, regardless of any other factors. In many cases, the number of Degrees of Success scored when passing the Focus Power Test determines some of the effects of the power—when this is the case, it will be noted in the power's description.

Many powers also indicate an Opposed Test, especially when used against an unwilling foe. If the Focus Power Test is an Opposed Test, the psyker must successfully pass the Test and gain more Degrees of Success than at least one of his opponents to activate the power. Note that even if the psyker loses the Opposed Test and does not activate the power, he still can generate a disturbance in the Warp if using the power at Unfettered or Push level.

#### Example

Chalse Bishopstead is a neophyte Sanctioned Psyker with a Willpower of 32 and a Psy Rating of 2. When using his psychic powers at the Push power level, Chalse's Focus Power Tests (before being modified by the power) that use Willpower will succeed on 47, 52, 57 or less (Willpower 32, + Psy Rating 3, 4, or 5 x 5).

### Resolve Power Results

After the psyker successfully manifests a psychic power, he triggers the effects specified in the psychic power description and, if Psychic Phenomena were manifested by the Focus Power test, rolls for the effects of the Psychic Phenomena.

#### Range and Line of Sight

Unless noted in its description, a psychic power that directly targets an individual or thing requires a psyker to have line of sight to (or otherwise be "aware" of) the target. The target must also be within the power's stated range, but there are no modifiers for range (Short, Point Blank, etc.).

#### Cumulative Effects

Modifiers, characteristic increases, and other benefits generated by psychic powers do not stack with each other—only the highest applies. They do stack with non-psychic bonuses, such as those granted by specialised equipment and environmental conditions.

#### Detecting Psychic Powers

Psykers are especially attuned to the Warp around them, able to sense the currents and eddies caused by other psykers dipping into the flow of the Immaterium. When psychic powers are in effect nearby, a psyker can make a Psyniscience test in order to determine their source. Others can also attempt this but, lacking a psyker's abilities, are less likely to succeed.

#### Psychic Phenomena

When a psyker reaches into the Warp, there is always the chance of the Empyrean bleeding into reality. Sometimes this manifestation is unique to the psyker, but in general it is as unpredictable as the Warp itself. Some effects can include a drop in temperature, ghostly voices, feelings of unease, or nearby vegetation shrivelling and dying. In rare instances, even full-scale Warp breaches can occur.

The precise effects a vary based on the nature of the psyker: the Sanctioned Psykers of the Imperium, the Librarians of the Adeptus Astartes, and the traitorous Sorcerers of the Chaos Space Marines draw on less power but can use it more safely. Unsanctioned psykers and mortal wyrds are subject to harsher effects, but can draw more deeply in return. Those who are not mortal (that is, those with the Daemonic trait) remain largely unperturbed by such trivial fluctuations of the Warp, and suffer far less severe phenomena. These varying effects are described on Table Psychic Strength.

If the psyker rolled doubles (or if the power was pushed) during his Focus Power test, a phenomenon occurs and the psyker must roll Psychic Phenomena. Particularly high rolls on this table can result in the psyker having to also roll Perils of the Warp. A few powers, as noted in their descriptions, cause other effects upon the material world when they manifest.

#### Resisting Enemy Psychic Powers

If they are attacked by enemy psychic powers, psykers have far better mental defences than "normal" people, using the power of the Warp to fight back. When making an Opposed Focus Power Test to resist a psychic attack, a psyker may select a power level (Fettered, Unfettered or Push), and add his resultant Psy Rating to the Willpower Test to resist the enemy power. However, if resisting at Unfettered or Push level and his roll is a double, this generates Psychic Phenomena, in just the same way as the attacker.

#### Psy Ratings in Psychic Powers

Unless specifically stated otherwise, all references to psy rating in a power (such as for range or damage) are based on the final, effective psy rating used when manifesting the power. This means that if the psyker manifests a power at a value beneath his base psy rating, a power that has effects based on psy rating is going to do less than if he pushes.

#### Sustaining Psychic Powers

Some psychic powers can be sustained for a prolonged period of time, as noted in their description. A psyker may sustain such powers without the need to make further Focus Power tests, taking only a small amount of effort to sustain a single power. However, attempting to maintain multiple powers at once becomes increasingly taxing, dividing the psyker's attention between several simultaneous effects and requiring ever greater amounts of concentration.

Any power that can be sustained has a listed action which defines how much effort the power requires to sustain—for example, a power with a sustain requirement of Half Action requires a Half Action each turn to sustain its effects. If the psyker is only attempting to sustain a single power, this is enough to maintain the effects. Any power that does not have the required action spent to sustain it ends at the end of the psyker's turn.

Sustaining multiple powers is more difficult. Any character attempting to sustain two or more powers at once must spend the longest action from the sustain requirements of all the powers being sustained, and reduces the effective psy rating for each power by the number of powers being sustained. More perilous still, the amount of energy the psyker is attempting to wield becomes unstable, swiftly going out of control at the most minor slip of concentration. Should the psyker cause Psychic Phenomena while sustaining more than one power, he must add +10 to the result rolled on Psychic Phenomena for every power after the first he is sustaining.

At the GM's discretion, PCs and particularly important NPCs can attempt to break free from powers being sustained against them. After a duration determined by the GM, such a character can attempt the same Opposed test to resist the power again; if the character wins the Opposed test, he breaks free of the power.

## Psychic Bolts

A number of powers produce blasts or energy bolts that inflict harm in a manner not dissimilar to a weapon. These powers all follow the same basic rules. The psyker must nominate a single target within range and line of sight; if the Focus Power test is successful, then the target is hit. Use the Focus Power test as the attack test to determine the Hit Location. There are three further variations on this: Psychic Barrages, Psychic Storms, and Psychic Blasts. Psychic Bolts of all kinds can be dodged as if they were any other kind of ranged attack. A successful Dodge test is sufficient to avoid a normal Psychic Bolt. Dodging a Psychic Storm or Psychic Blast is resolved in the same way as dodging Auto-Fire or Area Effect attacks, respectively.

### Psychic Barrage

A Psychic Barrage is a cluster of bolts of energy, similar to a semi-automatic weapon. If the Focus Power test succeeds, then the psyker produces one Psychic Bolt for the initial degree of success, plus one for every two additional degrees of success. The number of hits scored in this manner cannot exceed the psyker's effective psy rating when using this power. The first hit must strike the initially chosen target, while any subsequent hits may strike either the initial target or any other targets within two metres, providing all of the targets are within range and line of sight.

### Psychic Storm

A Psychic Storm comprises many bolts of energy, similar to fully automatic weapon fire. If the Focus Power test succeeds, then the psyker produces a number of Psychic Bolts equal to the number of degrees of success. The number of hits scored in this manner cannot exceed the psyker's effective psy rating when using this power. The first hit must strike the initially chosen target, while any subsequent hits may strike either the initial target or any other targets within two metres, providing all of the targets are within range and line of sight.

### Psychic Blast

A Psychic Blast detonates to cover a wide area, affecting multiple targets simultaneously. The psyker must nominate a single point in space anywhere within range and line of sight. If the Focus Power test is successful, then every target within the radius of the Psychic Blast is hit by the power.

## Gaining Psychic Powers

A character can only use psychic powers he has purchased. Any character with a psy rating of 1 or higher can purchase powers by spending experience points gained during play. To purchase a psychic power, a character must meet all its prerequisites. The amount of experience points required to purchase a psychic power is listed in that power's entry.

## Power Format

Each psychic power is presented using the following format:

**Name:** The power's name.

**Cost:** This number represents the amount of experience required to learn the power. Psychic powers are purchased with experience points.

**Prerequisites:** Some techniques require the psyker to have first learnt other ways to use his abilities. He must possess the powers (or other prerequisites) listed in order to learn the power.

**Action:** The Focus Power action required to activate the power. This is usually a Free Action, Half Action, Full Action, Reaction, or an Extended Action.

**Focus Power:** This states the characteristic used in Focus Power tests to activate this power (normally Willpower, but occasionally other characteristics are used), and whether the Focus Power test is Opposed. The difficulty of the power is also noted here.

**Range:** The range at which the power can be used is usually expressed in metres or kilometres, multiplied by the PR at which the power was used. If the range is a radius, this is always measured with the psyker at its centre. Radius applies to a sphere around the psyker and so will extend up, down, and in every other direction.

**Sustained:** This states whether the power can be sustained, and what action is required to sustain the power. This entry will always be one of the following: No, Free Action, Half Action, or Full Action.

**Subtype:** This denotes the specific action subtypes for the Focus Power test of the power. For more information on action subtypes see Combat.

**Effect:** This details the power's rules, including variables that the psyker's effective psy rating, or the degrees of success from the Focus Power test, have on the power's final strength. Whenever a power's description refers to the psyker's psy rating, it means the psyker's effective psy rating for the power, not his base psy rating.

**Psychic Phenomena:** Some unusual powers cause alternate or additional Psychic Phenomena. If the power uses only the normal Psychic Phenomena rules, this section will be absent.
