    "information": "Through the power of the Warp, telekines translate mental impulses into physical force. Powers from the telekinesis discipline can defy gravity, blast opponents with invisible bolts of force, and even tear holes in the very fabric of reality. Such powers offer great utility in a variety of situations, for they allow a psyker to affect the world around him without the constraints of his physical body.",

Instead, at the beginning of each turn the psyker is sustaining the vortex, he must make a Challenging (+0) Willpower test with a â€“5 penalty for each metre in the vortex's current radius. If he passes the test, he may perform one of the following actions: \n* Increase the vortex's radius by one metre. \n* Decrease the vortex's radius by one metre. \n* Move the vortex any direction a number of metres equal to the psyker's psy rating. \n\nIf the psyker fails the Willpower test to sustain the vortex, or if he is unable to make the test due to other circumstances, its radius increases by one metre and it moves a number of metres equal to the psyker's psy rating in a random direction. If the vortex's radius ever decreases to zero metres, the power ends and the vortex disappears. If the vortex's radius ever grows larger than the psyker's psy rating, it explodes, ending the power, and destroying the vortex. \n\nPsychic Blast; 2d10+4\\*PR X; Pen Vortex Radius; Special: Blast (2\\*PR)\n\nThe psyker is hit by this damage regardless of his proximity to the exploding vortex as the energy of the Warp he was channelling lashes back into him",
