    "information": "Perhaps the most ancient of psychic disciplines, divination foretells the future. Though diviners may seek answers by scattering animal entrails or studying the movement of stars, it is in fact the timeless realm of the Warp to which they turn. The powers of divination are of inestimable use to an Inquisitor and her Acolytes in the pursuit of their duties, both in the frenzied arena of combat and while undertaking investigative pursuits.",

This could be launching an ambush, hiding a heretical tome, or enacting a blood-soaked sacrifice. \n\n2 - Enemy Movements: The psyker's visions stretches over a wide area, able to see all activity within an entire battlefield or hive level. However, she is unable to focus her vision enough to see the exact details at an individual level. \n\n3 - Enemy Numbers: The psyker controls the focus of her vision. She is aware of all previous effects and is also able to discern details as to individual activities and exact enemy numbers. \n\n4+ - Enemy Plans: The psyker breaks through the veil of time, seeing an area and the countless possible outcomes of conflicts within it. She is aware of all previous effects, and also knows details of the plots any enemy leaders are planning.",
