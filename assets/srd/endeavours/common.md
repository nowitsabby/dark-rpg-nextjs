# Endeavours

In Rogue Trader, the Player Characters take on the role of interstellar traders, adventurers, and explorers, pushing back the boundaries of the dark frontier and claiming the wealth of whole worlds\. Theirs is a destiny far removed from the common citizens of the Imperium which will take them across the stars and grant them wealth and power on an unprecedented scale\. Capturing this grandeur can be challenging for the Game Master, as can bringing to life the layers of servants, holdings, and obligations that the Explorers inherit as part of their dynasty\. Also, unlike many roleplaying games, the Player Characters are not lone adventurers or even servants of a greater power out solely for personal gain\. They are part of something much greater—beginning play as already part of a powerful stellar trading family and in command of a near priceless void\-ship\. Endeavours are a process intended to help aid the GM in bringing this world of solar cartels and void\-faring traders to life and to allow the PCs to undertake truly impressive feats worthy of their status as Rogue Traders\. Core to the concept of the Explorers’ wealth is their Profit Factor which charts the power, influence, and raw wealth of their dynasty\. An Endeavour is an undertaking intended to increase this wealth, geared toward a particular aspect of the Rogue Trader’s mission—be it exploration, trade, or conflict\. While an Endeavour can become an adventure in itself, it can also exist in the background with the PCs offering limited input while pursuing other things\.

# Creating an Endeavour

The best way to think of an Endeavour is as a business venture by the Explorers—an investment of time, resources, and sometimes direct influence all intended to turn a profit\. Endeavours can come about in two ways: either as a result of the plans of the Explorers or as a set scenario created by the GM\. In both cases, all Endeavours have a number of things in common\.

## Requirements

All Endeavours have essential components that the Explorers must have before they can begin\. Some of these will need to be acquired using their Profit Factor\. The requirements for an Endeavour can be pretty much anything the GM deems vital to its completion\. For instance, if the Explorers were undertaking an Endeavour to transport cargo from one system to another, they would require two things: a cargo and a warp\-capable ship\. Some requirements the Explorers will already have—like their vessel—while others will need to be either found or acquired\. Sometimes gathering together the perquisite requirements for an Endeavour can be a mission in itself, as the Explorers chase contracts, seek out ancient warp routes, or haggle over rare cargos\. How easy or difficult the GM makes meeting the requirements is up to him, but he should remember not to allow the acquiring of requirements to overshadow the Endeavour itself\.

## Endeavour Size

For convenience’ sake, all Endeavours are placed into three broad rankings: Lesser, Greater, and Grand\. This serves as a guide for both the GM and players as to how difficult the Endeavour will be to complete and how much it will increase their Profit Factor\. These varying sizes are, of course, only presented as a guide, and the GM should feel free to scale Endeavours as he sees fit, setting his own difficulty, duration, and Profit actor increase\.

#### Lesser

These Endeavours should only last a session or two and should be relatively simple to complete—such as completing a cargo run or scouting a small and relatively harmless world\. Completing a Lesser Endeavour should increase Profit actor by 1 or 2 points\.

#### Greater

These Endeavours are proportionally more difficult and will require at least a few sessions to complete— such as purging a system of xeno influence or charting a new warp route\. Completing a Greater Endeavour should increase Profit actor by 3 or 4 points\.

#### Grand

These are the most challenging of Endeavours and will always have numerous parts and obstacles to overcome— such as restoring a Calixis noble house to glory or settling an entire star system\. Completing a Grand Endeavour should increase Profit actor by 5 points or more\.

## Objectives

To make the GM’s job easier, Endeavours can be broken down into parts called objectives\. Each objective is a waypoint or minor goal within the greater undertaking, each of which must be overcome by the Explorers before the Endeavour is complete\. For example, an Endeavour requiring the rescue of an Explorator Mission on a remote death world might be broken down into finding the world, braving the death world to find the Mission, and escaping the system with the Mission on board\. Typically, an Endeavour is divided into three objectives—though this is just a guide and the GM can either increase or decrease this amount to suit his purposes\.

## Achievement Points

To help the GM determine when the Explorers have successfully completed an objective—and by extension an Endeavour—he can use Achievement Points\. These points are awarded for completing individual tasks and overcoming obstacles toward resolving the Endeavour\. Each Endeavour has an overall amount of points required to complete it, which in turn are divided amongst its objectives\. When the Explorers have amassed enough points within an objective, they will have completed it and may move on to the next objective—until they complete the last one and complete the Endeavour\. Table Endeavour Scale details the number of Achievement Points a group of explorers needs to accumulate based on the size of an Endeavour\. Once the GM knows how many Achievement Points an Endeavour is worth, he should divide them equally among its objectives—so for example, for a Greater Endeavour with three objectives, each one would be worth 400 points\. If he chooses, the GM can “stack” Endeavour Points into certain objectives, making them harder and longer to complete to represent their importance\. Thus, the same Greater Endeavour could have three objectives worth 200, 600, and 400 points, respectively, reflecting comparatively how involved they are\.

### Endeavour Scale
__Size__   |__Achievement Points Needed__
-------|-------------------------
Lesser |900                      
Greater|1200                     
Grand  |1500                     

### Awarding Achievement Points

During the course of an Endeavour, the GM awards Achievement Points whenever the Explorers overcome a challenge or encounter related to the Endeavour\. The amount of points they receive is based on the difficulty of the encounter or challenge\. The GM should use Table Achievement Point Awards as a guide for awarding Achievement Points to the Explorers\. As a benchmark, an encounter that requires some effort on the part of the Explorers but places them in no real peril is counted as Ordinary\. It falls to the GM, however, to decide the difficulty of each encounter based on the amount of resources, danger, and effort required on the part of the Explorers\.

#### Achievement Point Awards
__Encounter Difficulty__|__Points Awarded__
--------------------|--------------
Easy                |10            
Routine             |30            
Ordinary            |50            
Challenging         |100           
Difficult           |150           
Hard                |200           
Very Hard           |300           


### Objective Themes

Objective themes act as a guide for the GM and players as to the nature of the objective and the kinds of resources the Explorers will need to accomplish the objective\. Themes also have an effect on the amount of Achievement Points earned when an objective is completed by Explorers with certain Talents or Ship Components keyed to the objective\. The five most common objective themes include:

#### Military 

Military objectives have to do with combat, confrontation, defence, or any involvement of an organised military force such as the Imperial Guard\. 

#### Criminal

Criminal objectives are often associated with underworld contacts, such as pirates, underhive scum, corrupt officials, and smugglers\. 

#### Exploration

Exploration objectives have to do with the uncharted reaches of the galaxy\. Discovering a new warp route, plotting the location of bizarre celestial phenomena, or recording the passage through a particularly dangerous asteroid field are all examples of Exploration objectives\. 

#### Trade

Trade objectives rely upon economics\. Supply and demand, providing services or goods that no one else can or will, or convincing polar region natives to purchase cryo\-vaults all fall under this heading\. 

#### Creed

Creed objectives are focused on religion\. Spreading the faith of the Ministorum, erecting a massive idol for a feral tribe’s worship, or serving the interests of a radical sect are all examples of this theme\.

## Setting up Endeavours

An Endeavour can come about through the actions of the Explorers, or it can be set up by the GM\. For example, the PCs might decide they want to increase the wealth of their dynasty and, as a result, decide to seek out worlds to exploit within the Koronus Expanse\. This desire would then prompt the GM to create an Endeavour to help them realise their ambition\. Equally, the GM might come up with a plot that revolves around the Cold Trade between the Expanse and the Calixis Sector and decide to create an Endeavour which will then be presented to the PCs through the course of play\. However the seed of an Endeavour is planted, the GM can cultivate it using the elements and guidelines presented in this section\. Use the following checklist when developing an idea into an Endeavour: 

- __Determine the size of the Endeavour \(Lesser, Greater, or Grand\):__ This is the point where the GM decides how time\-consuming, difficult, and ultimately rewarding the Endeavour will be\. 
- __Set any requirements such as goods, allies, or worlds:__ Requirements should represent the bare minimum that the Explorers need to embark on the Endeavour\. 
- __Divide the Endeavour into objectives:__ Most Endeavours naturally fall into equal parts; however, the GM may want to single out special sections of an Endeavour as particularly hard or challenging\. 
- __Tally up Achievement Points:__ These can either be based on the size of the Endeavour or can be set by the GM\. The points are then divided among the objectives either equally or based on each objective’s importance\. 
- __Assign any appropriate themes to the Endeavour’s objectives:__ These will help set the tone for the Endeavour and its parts, giving a broad feel for what kind of approach the Explorers will need to take\. Once these basic elements are in place, the GM can flesh out the Endeavour as required for his purposes\.

### Running Endeavours

There are two ways for the GM to run an Endeavour: either in the foreground as a full\-blown adventure or in the background as part of the workings of the Explorers’ dynasty with NPCs handling most of the legwork and heavy lifting\. Endeavours run in the foreground are much like any other kind of adventure with the Explorers directly involved in the action and making decisions as challenges arise to thwart them\. These kinds of Endeavours can, therefore, be treated as adventures and centered around the PCs\.  By contrast, Endeavours run in the background occur during downtime—either at the start or end of a play session or between the action of the Explorers’ own adventures\. These kinds of undertakings are run by NPCs, allies, and the faceless legions of the PCs’ dynasty, with only a small degree of direction from the players themselves\. As a general rule, Endeavours run by subordinates will always be more problematic—a fact the Explorers should learn during the course of their dynasty’s rise to glory\. They should also take longer and be less profitable than those that the Explorers take a hand in personally—after all, if you want a job done right… 

Regardless of how the GM chooses to run an Endeavour, he should remember that it is a tool intended to help him capture the scale and grandeur of what it means to be a Rogue Trader and deal in the fates of worlds\. It should not supplant the GM’s own plots or the PCs’ own style of play\. For this reason, each group should decide amongst themselves how they want to use Endeavours\.

### Resolving Endeavours

An Endeavour is completed when the Explorers have resolved each of the Endeavour’s objectives as a result of earning enough Achievement Points\. Excess Achievement Points earned in one objective carry over into the next\. It is possible that the Explorers will fail to complete an objective within an Endeavour for one reason or another—perhaps a colony they were meant to save is destroyed or a shipment of rare cargo lost to the warp\. In these cases, the GM can allow the Explorers to still complete the overall Endeavour by gaining enough Achievement Points from the remaining objectives\. It can be imagined that they shift their efforts and adapt to the changing situation—exploiting new avenues of profit or shifting their direction of attack\. At the end of an Endeavour, it is possible that the Explorers have amassed more Achievement Points than they require\. In this case, excess Achievement Points can be converted into Profit\. For every full 100 Achievement Points they have beyond what is necessary to accomplish the Endeavor, they gain an additional \+1 to their Profit Factor\.
