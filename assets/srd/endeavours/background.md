# Background Endeavours 

There are times when a Rogue Trader needs something to happen, but doesn't have the time or inclination to do it herself. That's where Background Endeavours come in. Background Endeavours aren't a specific kind of Endeavour so much as they are a way to handle Common Endeavours that a Rogue Trader finds menial, beneath her station, or simply boring. They reflect the Rogue Trader's ability to let her “people” \(lackeys, proxies and functionaries\) handle things she would rather not do herself. 

Only Lesser and Greater Common Endeavours can be made Background Endeavours, however, as Grand Endeavours are too complicated and too important to leave to underlings. While making a Common Endeavour into a Background Endeavour can free a Rogue Trader up to do things she'd rather do, such as hunting down pirates or plundering backwater planets, the trade\-off is a reduction in the Profit Factor award and a greater chance that the Endeavour itself will be a failure. Making a Common Endeavour a Background Endeavour may get a potentially boring and undesirable task out of the Rogue Trader's hair, but since it's being done essentially unsupervised she can never be sure that it will get done correctly, if at all. While avoiding drudge work certainly has its benefits, Background Endeavours have a number of disadvantages that should always be taken into consideration. 

First and foremost, a Background Endeavour will never be as profitable as one undertaken directly by the player. Due to the fact that the player is essentially abdicating her responsibility for the Endeavour to a pack of NPCs, there will always be a reduction in the Endeavour's Profit Factor. This loss of Profit Factor reflects things like initial outlay of funds for the project, cost of hirelings and things that are missed, miscounted or flat\-out stolen by the NPCs entrusted with carrying out the task. See Background Endeavours and Profit Factor for more information on how the Profit Factor rewards of a common Endeavour are affected by changing it to a Background Endeavour. 

Secondly, lending credence to the saying that if someone wants something done right they need to do it themselves, whenever a Rogue Trader entrusts her underlings with a task there is a chance that complications could arise. No matter how good the underlings, there is always a chance that they will fail in their given task. Add to this the fact that the tasks are unsupervised and generally boring and menial, and you have a recipe for potentially spectacular failure. Failure by a Rogue Trader's underlings can mean anything from further loss of Profit Factor to embarrassment to the loss of men and material. A failure that's spectacular enough may even put an entire Meta Endeavour at risk. That's not to say that the effects of an underling's failure can't be mitigated, especially if the Rogue Trader catches the mistake in time. More often than not, however, the mistake isn't caught until it's too late and the Rogue Trader and her underlings will be held accountable. 

At its heart, the decision to make a Common Endeavour into a Background Endeavour is a strategic one. It is also a decision not to be entered into lightly. The good that comes out of it: getting someone else to do something a group doesn't want to do and still getting paid for it, is balanced by the bad: loss of Profit Factor and the real possibility of failure and the Rogue Trader having to clean up a mess and do the task anyway.

## Background Endeavours And Profit Factor 

As was stated above, a Background Endeavour is never as profitable as a Common Endeavour. The first thing that happens when a Common Endeavour becomes a Background Endeavour is that a set number of Profit Factor points are subtracted right off the top, one point for a Lesser Endeavour and two points for Greater Endeavour. The initial loss of points can never reduce the Profit Factor of a Background Endeavour to zero. This reflects the massive outlay of resources needed to organise a Background Endeavour. Furthermore, NPCs will never do more than the bare minimum required to get the job done, this means that there will no extra Achievement Points awarded and therefore none can be traded in for further Profit Factor rewards, reducing the potential profitability of the Endeavour even further. Depending on how successful the Endeavour is, or how badly the NPCs fail, more Profit Factor could be lost, even to the point where the players come out upside down on the deal and end up owing money instead of making any.

## Making Common Endeavours Into Background Endeavours 

Once the decision has been made to involve NPCs and make a Common Endeavour into a Background Endeavour, steps need to be taken by the Explorers to ensure that the thing gets done correctly. 

### Marshalling Resources 

Now that the decision has been made to make a Common Endeavour into Background Endeavour, the first step toward executing the order is a marshalling of resources. During this phase, the Explorers take stock of what they need to complete the Endeavour and what men and materiel they have at hand to commit to it. Chances are that the Explorers will have everything that they need, as they should have already planned to complete this as a Common Endeavour and prepared accordingly, and they can continue on with Executing the Orders. If this isn't the case, and the Explorers find themselves wanting, they must make Acquisition Tests to gather what they need.  When attempting to acquire mercenaries, surveyors, intermediaries or other hired help, the difficulty of the Acquisition Test is modified by the quality of the hirelings. A hireling's quality can be poor, common, good or best, and is roughly analogous to an item's Craftsmanship.

### Executing The Order 

When the Explorers have completed marshalling their resources, the player creating the Background Endeavour, typically the Rogue Trader, makes a Command Test. This Command Test is modified by two factors, input from other Explorers and the quality of the underlings set to the task. Other Explorers may help the character executing the Endeavour by making relevant skill tests and adding bonuses to the Command Test, such as a Navigator making a Navigation Test to double check a Rogue Trader's trade route. Each successful Skill Test made by a supporting character adds a \+10 bonus to the Command Roll. 

The quality of people hired to carry out the Endeavour also has an effect on the Command Test. See Table Hireling Quality Modifiers for the appropriate bonuses and penalties. After all modifiers are applied and the Command Test is made, the player making the Test then tallies up their success or failures to see how well she communicated her orders and how well they'll be followed. A simple success nets a flat 50% chance that the Background Endeavour will succeed. Every Level of Success attained increases the chances that the Background Endeavour will succeed by one step. 

If the player fails her Command Test, the Endeavour still goes forward as planned but every degree of failure increases the likelihood of total failure by one step. It is important to note that a failure on this test doesn't necessarily mean the Endeavour fails, although it does increase the chances. Instead, it simply means some sort of miscommunication or misunderstanding makes failure more likely.

#### Hireling Quality Modifiers
__Quality of Hireling__|__Command Test Modifier__|__Acquisition Test Modifier__
---|---|---
Poor |\-20 |\+10
Common |\+0 |\+0
Good |\+10 |\-20
Best |\+20 |\-30

### Further Modifying The Command Test 

If the Game Master allows it, the Command Test can be further modified by the acquisition of ships or equipment specifically designed for the task at hand. For example, hiring a ship specifically built for hauling perishable cargo to haul a load of fresh foodstuffs from one planet to another would grant a \+10 to the Background Endeavour's Command Test. The number of items and the modifiers they provide, if any, are solely the GM's discretion.

### Success, Failure, Time and Misfortune 

Once the Command Test has been made and the chance of the Endeavour's success has been recorded, the Explorers' parts in the Endeavour are pretty much at an end. The responsibility for the rest of the Endeavour now falls squarely on the Game Master's shoulders. There are a number of rolls that the GM needs to make to plot out the events of the Endeavour, and all of them take place out of the sight of the players. 

The first and most important roll that the GM has to make is the Endeavour Success Roll. After the Explorers made their Command Test, the Game Master records the chance of the Endeavour succeeding, a chance between 10% and 90%. The GM rolls d100, and any result under the chance percentage is a success, signifying that the Endeavour goes off without a hitch. Rolling above the chance percentage means that the Endeavour is a bust, and the Game Master then rolls on Table Severity of Failure to see just how bad the hired help has failed their employer. Once the severity of the failure has been established, the Game Master then either designs a scenario that explains the failure as it fits in with her game, or if she has no explanation, she just determines it randomly, using Table Misfortune Details. 

#### Severity of Failure
__d100__  |__Type of Mishap__   |__Profit Factor Lost__                                    
------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------
01-49 |Minor Mishap     |Endeavour fails, but no further profit factor is lost.
50-65 |Nuisance Mishap  |1                                                     
66-90 |Grim Mishap      |2                                                     
90-100|Calamitous Mishap|1d5                                                   

Whether or not the Endeavour succeeds, the Game Master needs to make a roll to see how long the Endeavour takes. Every Common Endeavour has, as part of its make up, a stated length of time that the Endeavour should take to complete. Underlings or hired help rarely, if ever, can be counted on to complete a task in the time allotted. To see how long it takes the underlings to complete their task, the GM rolls on Table Background Endeavour Completion Time. This roll is simply a reflection of how quickly a Rogue Trader's underlings follow her orders, and not necessarily indicative of the quality of the work. An underling can just as easily cut corners and finish early only to fail as she can take twice as long as the stated time to make sure that everything is just right.

#### Background Endeavour Completion Time
__d100__  |__% of Expected Time__
------|------------------
01-10 |25%               
11-25 |50%               
26-50 |75%               
51-70 |100%              
71-80 |125%              
81-90 |150%              
91-100|200%              

### Reaping Rewards and Dealing With Consequences 

Now that rolls have been made, success or failure has been determined, time has passed and the Explorers have done what they could to ensure their orders were followed to the letter, the time has come to enjoy the fruits of someone else's labour or to suffer the consequences of abject failure. This final phase of the Background Endeavour typically takes place months after the initial rolls were made and while the Explorers have been gallivanting around the galaxy fighting pirates or killing Xenos. The final result of the Endeavour is revealed to the Explorers, and they now either collect their Profit Factor or deal with the consequences of their hireling's failure. If the Endeavour was successful, the Explorers simply collect their Profit Factor and Achievement Points and go on their way. The successful completion of a Background Endeavour also has the possibility of providing the Explorers with useful contacts that they can use in the future. For example, the foodstuffs get delivered undamaged and ahead of schedule, netting the Explorers the remainder of their Profit Factor and the 600 Achievement Points for completing a Lesser Endeavour. The captain and crew of the merchant ship hired to move the foodstuffs has proven themselves as solid and reliable. The relationship between the Explorers and the merchant ship has been extremely amicable and profitable for both sides, and the merchant captain states that she would be more than happy to work with the Explorers whenever they needed her.

If the Endeavour has failed however, a whole new set of problems for the Explorers arises. First they need to figure out how much money, if any, has been lost on the Endeavour. A failed Endeavour generates no Profit Factor, and depending on the severity of the failure as determined by Table Severity of Failure, the Explorers could end up owing quite a bit of money to creditors and hirelings. These bills have no detrimental effect on the Explorers' Profit Factor, but will need to be paid and may have a deleterious effect on their reputations or Meta Endeavour. Payment of debts incurred during the course of a Background Endeavour requires a Difficult \(–10\) Profit Factor Test for each point of Profit Factor below zero. The Explorers can attempt to recoup their losses by either wringing money from the other parties involved in the Endeavour, or by attempting to fix the mistake and salvage what they can from the failed Endeavour. This is a perfect opportunity for good role\-playing and for the characters to use every bit of skill and luck to try to get some benefit from a bad situation.
