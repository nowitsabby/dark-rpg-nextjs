# Meta Endeavours 

Meta Endeavours are campaign\-level Endeavours in which the Explorers take an active role\. Each Meta Endeavour is made up of a number of separate Common Endeavours that are all part of a common theme\. They grant a Game Master the tools with which to create an epic Rogue Trader campaign that provides both distinct goals that the Explorers need to meet to advance the story and the freedom to achieve these goals in whatever way they see fit\. Like Common Endeavours, Meta Endeavours have a set number of Achievement Points that the Explorers need to collect to successfully complete them\. These Achievement Points are accrued both through completion of the separate Common Endeavours as well as by completing smaller tasks which can grant small amounts of Achievement Points at the discretion of the Game Master\. 

## Creating Meta Endeavours

Creating a Meta Endeavour is a laborious but ultimately satisfying project for both Game Masters and players\. They are typically designed solely by the GM after discussions with his players regarding the scope and type of campaign they are looking for\. For the Explorers, it gives them an idea about what characters would be appropriate and fun to play in the campaign, as well as an idea of what to expect from the GM\. It also provides tangible goals for them to work toward, which ultimately helps the Game Master move the game along\. For the Game Master, Meta Endeavours grant a broad framework to work within that grants both definite progress benchmarks and the freedom to alter them to best suit the direction the Campaign takes over the course of its life\. 

## Meta Endeavour Scope

The first thing to consider when designing a Meta Endeavour is the scope\. A Meta Endeavour's scope tells the GM and players approximately how long and involved the campaign will be\. It gives a rough idea of the number and type of Common Endeavours required for success, and how much the Explorers will gain in both Profit Factor and reputation\. The following Scopes, much like the size guidelines for Common Endeavours, are only guidelines for the GM to follow\. Game Masters should feel free to alter the size and requirements of the scopes to better fit their styles along with the playing styles of their players\. 

### Monumental

Meta Endeavours with a Monumental Scope typically last for a few months to a year and are confined to one small part of space\. A good example would be the charting of a new star cluster in the Koronus Expanse and opening it up to trade\. They will have six to eight Lesser and Greater Endeavours as their primary requirements, as well as numerous random encounters as they arise\. Monumental Scale Endeavours tend to be part of larger campaigns, and can be combined with other Monumental or Legendary Endeavours as the Game Master sees fit\. 

### Legendary

Legendary Scope Meta Endeavours can take anywhere from one to two years and could require the Explorers to cross and re\-cross Imperial Space to achieve their goals\. For example, the Rogue Trader and his crew have been tasked with scouring the entirety of the Koronus Expanse in search of ancient technology at the behest of the Adeptus Mechanicus\. Legendary Meta Endeavours will have eight to twelve Lesser and Greater Endeavours \(and possibly one or two Grand Endeavours\) as their primary requirement, as well as numerous random encounters\. Legendary Meta Endeavours, like their smaller Monumental Scale cousins, can be combined as the GM sees fit to make their campaign\. 

### Epic

Epic Meta Endeavours are extremely arduous and rewarding Imperium\-spanning campaigns that can last for years\. Explorers will take part in events that have the ability to change the galaxy as they know it, events that could make them unimaginably wealthy and bring them to the attention of highest members of the Imperial government\. A Meta Campaign with a truly Epic Scope could be one in which the Explorers set out to pacify the entirety of the Koronus Expanse in hopes of setting themselves up as its undisputed rulers\. Such a campaign would consist of twelve to sixteen Common Endeavours of each type along with countless side adventures and random encounters\. 

## Grand Endeavours as Part of Meta Endeavours 

Grand Endeavours are never used in Monumental Meta Endeavours, and only rarely in Legendary ones\. They are used in the construction of Epic Meta Endeavours, but even then the Game Master should use them sparingly\. Thanks to their size, complexity and potential profitability, they should be reserved for the final, grand undertaking needed to complete a Legendary Meta Endeavour or used as major story line or “chapter” breaks in an Epic Meta Endeavour\. For example, if the Game Master is running an Epic Scale Meta Endeavour in which the ultimate goal is the total obliteration of a Tyranid Hive Fleet, one of the Grand Endeavours contained within could require the players to find and destroy advanced flotillas of Genestealers that are flooding into a nearby system\.

## Designing Component Endeavours And Objectives 

Once the Scope of the Meta Endeavour has been agreed on, the GM must decide on the Endeavour's Objectives\. These objectives consist of the numerous Common Endeavours that make up the bulk of the Meta Endeavour\. These Common Endeavours are designed using the Endeavour rules found above, and function largely the same way that Objectives do in a Common Endeavour\. Each Common Endeavour within a Meta Endeavour acts as a waypoint, a benchmark by which the Explorers can measure their progress through the campaign\. When a Common Endeavour is completed, it is resolved as normal\. Achievement Points are recorded and any Profit Factor gained is added to the group's Profit Factor pool\. The Game Master may also organise the Common Endeavours into groups linked by the themes usually assigned to Common Endeavour Objectives\. These groups make up chapters within the Meta Endeavour, and are an easy tool to use to frame the rough order in which Common Endeavours need to be undertaken\. 

## Achievement Points 

Just as Common Endeavours require Achievement Points to complete, so too do Meta Endeavours\. Achievement Points are rewarded for completing the Lesser and Greater Endeavours that make up the Meta Endeavour, along with the numerous side adventures and random encounters that come up during any game session\. See Table Endeavour Scope and Table Achievement Point Awards for rules regarding the awarding of Achievement Points for both Common Endeavours and random encounters\. Each kind of Meta Endeavour has a set number of Achievement Points needed to complete it, dictated by the average number of Common Endeavours involved and their Achievement Point rewards\. See Table Meta Endeavour Scope for the number of Achievement Points needed to complete each type of Meta Endeavour\. 

### Meta Endeavour Scope

## Meta Endeavour Check List 

The following check list is a quick reference for Game Masters to aid them in creating their Meta Endeavours\. 

- Determine the Scope of the Meta Endeavour \(Monumental, Legendary or Epic\): The Game Master and his players discuss what they want from a game, the length of the campaign \(roughly\) and appropriate characters\. Once all of this is agreed on the Game Master chooses the Scope that fits his campaign best\. Choosing the Scope of the Meta Endeavour determines approximately how long it will take, along with the difficulty and Achievement Point Requirements\. 
- Design Component Common Endeavours: Based on the Meta Endeavour's Scope, the Game Master sets about designing the Common Endeavours that will form the body of the Meta Endeavour\. The GM may also make notes about possible side adventures and random encounters that he would like to include in the Endeavour\. 
- Divide the Meta Endeavour into Objectives and Assign Themes: Once the component Endeavours have been designed, the GM can now group them together based on common themes to form chapters within his Meta Endeavour\. Once all of the pieces have come together and the Game Master has a good idea of how he'd like things to go, the Meta Endeavour is ready to be played\. 

## Resolving Meta Endeavours 

Depending on the Scope of the Meta Endeavour, the resolution could simply have been one section of a grander idea forged by the Game Master, or the culmination of years of play that ends with the Explorers becoming major intergalactic figures, unimaginably wealthy and powerful\. Whatever the case, the Explorers have completed near superhuman tasks and deserve every reward that is coming to them\. In the case of Monumental and Legendary Scale Endeavours, the Achievement Points gained over the course of the Meta Endeavour are totaled and compared to the base Acquisition Point requirement\. Like a regular Common Endeavour, Meta Endeavours can still be completed even if the Explorers fail at one or more of the component Endeavours\. Achievement Points lost through failed Endeavours can be made up through random encounters and the pursuit of side adventures\. These points reflect the Explorers adapting to the fluid nature of life in the stars and new doors opening when others close\. 

- As with Common Endeavours, it's very likely that the Explorers have amassed more Achievement Points than needed to complete their Meta Endeavour\. These surplus points can now be converted into Profit Factor at the rate of \+1 point of Profit Factor for every 100 excess Achievement Points\. To say that Meta Endeavours are extremely profitable is a gross understatement\. 
- Epic Meta Endeavours are resolved slightly differently than Monumental and Legendary Endeavours, as they are largely their own reward\. Achievement Points are tallied normally, and the ability to make up for failed Common Endeavours is still present\. In this case however, excess Achievement Points cannot be converted into Profit Factor\. Since Epic Endeavours are typically full campaigns, by the climax the Explorers should either be wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, extremely powerful and influential in the highest levels of the Imperium, or perhaps dead, corrupted or even worse\. Once the Epic Endeavour is completed, the campaign is, for all intents and purposes, over and it's time to make new characters and seek new adventures elsewhere in the Imperium\.
