# Example Endeavours

Presented below is a selection of these Endeavour types and their requirements, as well as a number of specific Endeavours for each, is presented here for the GM to either use as is or to draw inspiration from.

## Establish an Imperial Colony
A Rogue Trader can provide what others cannot: passage into the Halo Stars. Incidental passengers are easy to find, but an Endeavour requires greater diversity of effort. The Rogue Trader needs a suitable colony world, connections with beast hunters, explorers, and nobles, signed pilgrim-compacts with sects of the Imperial Cult, and agreements with the Great Houses.

Example Requirements:
* A suitable world
* Preliminary surveys to confirm viability for habitation
* Colony hab-installations
* Atmosphere-machines or other protective devices
* A binding compact with the Machine Cult to support colony machinery
* A partnership with high functionaries in the Calixis Sector, such as leaders in the Ministorum or a Great House, who desire a colony established in their name
* An organisation of negotiators and brokers to accept Thrones for passage for would-be colonists and to negotiate a wide range of one-time transport compacts with Imperial organisations.

### The First Colony of Grace

_Greater Endeavour, +4 Profit Factor_

The Lady Aspyce Chorda used her connections with the Cold Guild and other shadowy organisations to ferry wealthy fugitives from Imperial justice to the Foundling World of Grace. The fugitives themselves paid for their fortified, palatial colony structures, whilst Chorda provided slaves from a variety of unsavoury sources. She profited greatly until the ravening Orks laid waste to Grace.

#### Objective 1: Confirm Grace as a Suitable Colony World

__Themes:__ Exploration

Explorers and surveyors must descend like thistle down from the Rogue Trader's vessel, and all signs of toxins, taint, and unholy 280 IX: Playing the Game presences investigated. Who knows what might be missed if hirelings are left to complete these tasks unsupervised.

#### Objective 2: Establish Dominance Over the Cold Guild

__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade

The fiercely independent Cold Guild representatives must be made to bow to the Rogue Trader's will, either through respect or terror of the consequences of resistance.

#### Objective 3: Cleanse the Near Voids of Pirate Scum

__Themes:__ Exploration, Military

No Foundling World is safe whilst reavers of Iniquity roam its system voids with impunity. Their vessels must be found and their leaders made to fear the Rogue Trader's presence.

### The Second Colony of Grace

_Lesser Endeavour, +2 Profit Factor_

At some point in time, the ruins of Grace become attractive to a different Rogue Trader, one who sees Profit Factor in raising up a more holy colony in the God-Emperor's name.

#### Objective 1: Crush the Feral Orks Who Infest the Ruins

__Themes:__ Military

The Imperial ruins of Grace are overrun with tribes of feral Orks, the cast-off seeds of past battles. They must be purged from this world and their spores charred from the ground where they lie.

#### Objective 2: Forge an Alliance with a Ministorum Cult

__Themes:__ Creed

The Rogue Trader must obtain allies and succeed in negotiations such that the Drusians or Vitrian Covenant open their coffers in support of the Rogue Trader's goals and exhort their followers in pilgrimage to this new world.

#### Objective 3: Raise up the Pilgrim Horde
__Themes:__ Creed, Trade

From the faithful of Port Wander and Footfall, the Rogue Trader must gather a pilgrim horde to fill great-holds with prayer and find Ecclesiarchs to lead them. The Rogue Trader must convince them to empty their purses for passage, carry them to Grace, and settle them in new colony-habs and shrines.

## Exploit a Resource World

Uncharted worlds host strange xenos beasts, rare ores, gems, and a hundred other natural riches. To exploit such a resource, the Rogue Trader must set down workers and installations from orbit and later return to the world to carry away the riches. Connections must be set up with factors and merchant houses of the Drusus Marches to obtain the best price for the materials brought back to civilisation.

Example Requirements:
* A resource world
* Wide-ranging survey expeditions carried out to identify and characterise resources
* Mineheads, refineries, macroharvesters, hunting bases, or other appropriate resource installations
* Bulk lift transports to carry material to orbit
* A binding compact with the Machine Cult to support necessary machinery
* A population of labourers and specialists
* A small organisation of brokers and scribes to manage the flow of resources
* Secure storage vaults in Port Wander
* Compacts of trade struck with factors and influential merchant houses of the Drusus Marches, or a trade alliance with a great organisation, such as the Machine Cult of a forge world, a Great House, or Departmento Munitorum.

### Establish a Beast Trade from the Unvisited World of Tvalde IV

_Greater Endeavour, +3 Profit Factor_

Imperial circuses and Magi-Xenobiologis of the Machine Cult are ever hungry for new xenos beasts. The death worlds of Burnscour and Valcetti's Salvation are known now, if not completely catalogued. New and unexpected horrors must be found on unexplored worlds of the Koronus Expanse if greater profit is to be made.

#### Objective 1: Locate Tvalde IV and Catalogue Its Worst Horrors

__Themes:__ Exploration

Mentioned only once in the logs of Parsimus Dewain and nowhere else, this dread and rumoured deathworld must be located in the voids. Thence, explorers, factors, and hunters experienced in the beast trade can be carried there to assess the vile, deadly xenos and determine from what regions and breeds the best profit can be made.


#### Objective 2: Gain Powerful Beast Trade Allies

__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade

The beast trade of the Drusus Marches is as much criminal as legitimate. The black markets and forbidden forms of xenos are where the greatest reward—and the greatest risk—lie. Profit demands that alliances be made on both sides of Imperial justice, and they must be influential, perhaps dangerous, figures in order to provide the level of recompense a Rogue Trader desires: Imperial Governors, Archmagi, crime barons of the Kasballica, and others.

#### Objective 3: Cull the Dread Herds

__Themes:__ Exploration, Military

In the company of many hunters and other militants, protected by Imperial tech-devices, the Rogue Trader's mission must slaughter and capture terrifying beasts to fill great-holds many times over. Further, the bases for future expeditions must be established and the results of this grand hunt brought back to Imperial space for the profit they will bring.

### Enter the Nephium Trade of Lucin's Breath

_Lesser Endeavour, +2 Profit Factor_

The Winterscale lineage has for centuries benefited from pure nephium found on the frozen resource world of Lucin's Breath, using it to gain favour with forge world Archmagi. Vast refineries, drill-machinery, and bulk-lifter ruins from years long past litter Lucin's Breath, and tens of thousands of serfs and slaves toil within presently active installations. Yet there is still room for a new Rogue Trader to violently establish a refinery zone.

#### Objective 1: Make Your Mark and Clear the Zone

__Themes:__ Military

Clear a new sinkhole refinery zone of frozen battle-debris, and burn down incursions by the slave-forces of Winterscale and Chorda to establish that this Rogue Trader is here to stay.

#### Objective 2: Tame the Lucinite Xenos

__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade

Forcing the Lucinite breed to toil in the frigid gas-snow outside Imperial installations is a great advantage and is necessary to success on Lucin's Breath now that Rogue Traders vie for its treasure with such great violence. The secrets of their slavery must be wrested from other Rogue Traders' servants, and a cadre of xenos-trainers established.

#### Objective 3: Challenge the Rival Rogue Traders

__Themes:__ Military, Trade

Unless partnership, dominance, respect, or fear is established, then the new installations will soon enough be destroyed from orbit by the void-ships of Lady Aspyce Chorda or Lord-captain Calligos Winterscale. The Rogue Trader must seek out these rivals and force a better outcome.

## Establish a Cold Trade from Dead Xenos Worlds

The “Cold Trade” is the name given to the black market in xenos materials, much of it illegal despite the terms of a Rogue Trader's Warrant of Trade. Xenos artefacts are rarer than common resources, but also more dangerous to trade within the Imperium. A Rogue Trader must make diligent efforts to develop a secure web of connections to smugglers and crime barons of the Cold Trade, as well as to wealthy collectors and xenosavants.

Example Requirements:
* Xenos worlds, usually long dead
* Initial archeo-excavations and site surveys to identify potentially valuable artefacts
* Base installations and exploration vehicles
* A few orbital shuttle vehicles
* A binding compact with the Machine Cult to support necessary machinery
* Well-equipped groups of explorers and savants
* Secure relationships with a few highly placed and influential collectors or savants of xenos works, or with diverse Cold Trade smugglers and collectors of the forbidden.
 
### A Cold Trade from the Blasted Cineris Malificum

_Grand Endeavour, +5 Profit Factor_

In the 5th century M41, Balastus Irem established a fantastically lucrative Cold Trade in horrid artefacts recovered from cyclopean ruins upon dead worlds of the Cineris Malificum. His coffers swelled enormously as a result of this Endeavour. Little is known of the details of Balastus Irem's allies, trade partners, voyages, and archeo-excavations, for Ordo Xenos forces expunged the Irem lineage and all their works in 443.M41, on suspicion of the most dire heresy.

#### Objective 1: Establish Promising Archeosites

__Themes:__ Exploration

The ruins of the Cineris Malificum worlds are so ancient and vast they have become hills and valleys. Past archeosites are visible from orbit, some blasted in unknown assaults. New dig sites must be located, and a horde of explorers and savants unleashed upon these dread worlds to find the most promising locations for new discoveries. Dangers and eldritch horrors of an ancient xenos past that have claimed previous expeditions must be evaded or overcome. Eldar may appear and attempt to warn off, assassinate, or threaten explorers.

#### Objective 2: Develop a Cold Trade Network of Wealthy Clients

__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade

There is great risk attendant on entering the Cold Trade,even for a Rogue Trader. Potential buyers of great wealth and influence must be approached with caution—lest the Imperial authorities hear of these activities and lest the shadowy powers of the Drusus Marches underworld intervene. There are guides through this dangerous underworld, such as the Kasballica representatives of Footfall, but even they are difficult to approach.

#### Objective 3: Defeat the Treacherous Eldar

__Themes:__ Military

The Eldar have some unknown interest in the dead worlds of the Cineris Malificum, and their ghost-vessels have been known to assault Rogue Traders who mine xenos tombs for artefacts and strange sigils. The Eldar must be driven back when they appear in force.

### A Cold Trade in Materials of the Egarian Dominion

_Greater Endeavour, +3 Profit Factor_

The strange hive-ruins of the deserted Egarian worlds are formed of a strange material that can generate great wealth when provided to the right organisations. Sometimes artefacts are found in the empty, wind-wracked structures, and these rare items can be yet more lucrative. A number of Rogue Traders have participated in the Egarian Cold Trade over the centuries, enough for established buyers and traditions to exist at the edges of Imperial society.

#### Objective 1: Establish a Warp Route to the Egarian Worlds

__Themes:__ Exploration

The shifting warp of Winterscale's Realm and the obsessive secrecy of those who harrow xenos worlds leaves navigation to the Egarian Dominion an uncertain proposition. A route must be established through the dangers of the Empyrean of the Expanse and the strange warp-phenomena that surround the Egarian stars. There are ugly currents in these voids that few Rogue Traders are willing to speak of, and some voidfarers believe them haunted.

#### Objective 2: Develop a Cold Trade Network of Wealthy Clients

__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade

The trade in Egarian materials is presently accepted as falling within the bounds of a Warrant of Trade, and so has far less attendant risk than selling other xenos artefacts. Nonetheless, few potential buyers stand on the right side of Imperial authority. A Rogue Trader will often find himself forging an unwilling compact of trade with the Kasballica to generate the profit he desires.

#### Objective 3: Seek Out Value in the Hive-ruins

__Themes:__ Exploration

Led by rare savants of Egarian lore, the Rogue Trader's mission must enter or even tear apart the hive-ruins of an Egarian world in search of the shards, sheets, and artefacts valued by the Cold Trade. This is dangerous toil, wherein explorers are under threat of becoming lost forever in the crumbling hive-mazes, or crushed and sliced apart by falling shards. Expeditions past have vanished utterly upon these worlds, leaving only deserted camps behind them, and no one knows what has become of such unfortunate souls. Something preys upon those who come here; that much is certain.

## Establish a Trade Route

Establishing a reliable path through the treacherous warp is but the first part of building a trade route. Desirable goods must be identified, which usually requires local knowledge, and trade must be supported by compacts negotiated with rulers, merchants, and law-wrights; that process can be costly. The Degree of the Endeavour depends on what is traded, the level of competition from other traders, and the terms of the compacts: no potentate will stand idle whilst traders make wealth for themselves. A large cut is always expected, one way or another.

Example Requirements:
* Two or more human worlds
* Identified warp routes between the worlds
* Compacts of trade negotiated with leaders upon each world
* A modest organisation of factors and negotiators upon each world
* A small organisation of brokers and scribes
* Secure storage vaults upon each world
* A compact of partnership with a great organisation, such as a Great House or the Munitorium, who will benefit from this trade

### Create a Macrocannon Trade Route from Zayth

_Grand Endeavour, +5 Profit Factor_

Given time, Jonquin Saul—or perhaps another Rogue Trader—will establish a profitable trade route to the Heathen Stars.Perhaps it will involve the weapon manufactories of Zayththat produce vast macrocannons of a pattern unknown to theCalixis Sector. Saul is still in the early stages of establishing allies amongst the heathens of that world, however. It is a delicate process, for the coming of outsiders has roiled the heathen cultures.

#### Objective 1: Establish a Warp Route to Zayth

__Themes:__ Exploration

Long routes through the turbulent warp of the Koronus Expanse are a dire and terrifying prospect, and the Heathen Stars are far indeed from Footfall, far even from the better known worlds of Winterscale's Realm. A route must be established, however, and potential dangers and layover worlds along the way explored. These are treacherous, unknown voids, and almost anything might emerge to threaten an exploring fleet

#### Objective 2: Gain Allies Amongst the Zaythi Powers

__Themes:__ Creed, Military, Trade

Gaining the trust of any Zaythi faction is a grand challenge. Their world is roiled, its hive vehicles set against one other, and the old ways falling apart. Perhaps a deal can be struck in propping up a losing faction, in creating zealots of the Imperial Creed amongst forsaken Zaythi, in striking down an enemy hive vehicle, or in overturning a hated organisation.

#### Objective 3: Aid the Zaythi Against the Orks

__Themes:__ Military

To seal the compacts of trade, it is necessary to perform a great deed of vengeance against the green-skinned demons who fall from the sky—the terrible Orks. Zathyi allies wish to accompany the Rogue Trader's force away from Zayth to witness a strike against the Ork foe in the name of the Silvered God of War.

### Forge a Guilder's Route from Port Wander to the Drusus Marches

_Lesser Endeavour, +2 Profit Factor_

When needs must, a Rogue Trader can act in the manner of a common Free Trader or Chartist Captain and use his influence to carry rarities from the storehouses of Port Wander to the churning markets of Drusus Marches hives. He will be scorned by his peers, and mocked behind his back by the very merchants he associates with, but a path to wealth is a path to wealth.

#### Objective 1: Ally with Greater Rogue Traders

__Themes:__ Trade

To ensure a great enough flow of rarities and favoured pick of strange goods, the Rogue Trader must go before his peers for assistance. Some Rogue Traders are reluctant to enter into such compacts, either through suspicion or a misplaced sense of loyalty to the ideal of the Warrant of Trade.

#### Objective 2: Establish a Hive World Market

__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade 

The Rogue Trader and his factors must descend upon a hive world of the Drusus Marches and there forge a reliable market of buyers and client organisations for this trade. Hive worlds are vile nests of devious law-wrights, scheming nobles, and guilders who think nothing of ruining all who leave themselves open to assault. Treachery and well-dressed thieves must be overcome in order to find those whose remnant honesty or greed will keep them loyal.

#### Objective 3: Defend the Reputation of the Lineage

__Themes:__ Creed, Trade

Bold action must be taken in Port Wander to ensure that the Rogue Trader does not become an outcast amongst Imperial nobility and the high functionaries of the Port. The Rogue Trader's name is threatened by undertaking common trade between worlds. Other Rogue Traders, like Jonquin Saul, have overcome a Free Trader's origins and gained respect—so it can be done. Largess, obtaining noble allies through means fair and foul, and many other strategies are possible.
