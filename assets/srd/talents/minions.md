# Minions

The greatest champions seldom stand alone, nor do they do all their own dirty work. Instead they can call upon legions of fanatical servants and followers, each one enamoured of the champion and willing to spend their life for his cause. Characters are no different, and as they grow in power they can gather a following of creatures and warriors to their side to aid them in their rise to glory, using the strong backs and sharp blades of their underlings to advance their own interests, and even compel them to die in their stead should the need arise—as it so often does upon the path to glory.

Minions are special followers which Characters can gain for themselves much as they might acquire a lasting reputation or a piece of valued equipment. Unlike the aid of friendly NPCs which may be fleeting and half-hearted (and still subject to the control of the GM) a Minion is under the direct control of the player just like his own character and though it might not always follow his orders to the letter it is as loyal as followers are likely to get. In time players can even gather a number of Minions for their Characters which bolsters his fighting abilities; grants him access to Skills, Talents, and Traits he might not have; and— most importantly—die for him should he so choose.

## Creating Minions

When a Character takes a Minion Talent (either Greater Minion, Minion, or Lesser Minion), they gain the service of a Minion. Minions do not spontaneously appear out of nowhere, of course, and a player needs to come up with a reason why his Character has acquired the Minion, usually worked out with the aid of the GM. This could be as simple as buying a slave from a feral world market or enticing a soldier away from his warlord with the promise of glory and coin, or as complex as making a lasting pact with a powerful organisation like a Chaos Space Marine Legion and gaining the "assistance" of one of their warriors. The GM may also offer a character a Minion as part of an adventure, should an NPC become tied to the PCs and wish to enter their service (in this case the character still needs to take the appropriate Minion Talent). However it occurs, Minions should be added to a character during downtime between adventures or game sessions; after all bonds of loyalty taking time to strengthen. Once a character has acquired a Minion a player can then create it using the rules below. There are no restrictions on what Characteristics, Skills, Talents or Traits a Minion can have beyond those imposed by being a Lesser, Normal or Greater Minion. The GM does however have final say over a Minion's abilities before it enters play. All Minions fall into three categories of ascending power:

- Lesser (chosen using the Lesser Minion Talent)
- Normal (chosen using the Minion Talent)
- Greater (chosen using the Greater Minion Talent)

Which type of Minion it is determines the level of its characteristics and its access to Skills, Talents, and Traits. Apart from these factors, however, there are no other restrictions on the exact form a Minion may take and players are encourage to be inventive.

### Characteristics

All Minions have a set of characteristics just like PCs and NPCs representing their various strengths and weaknesses. Minions have a pool of points which they can divide amongst their characteristics depending on their level of power. When creating a Minion divide up these points between Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Toughness, Agility, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower and Fellowship. A Minion's characteristics cannot be less than 01 (i.e. players must put at last 1 point into each characteristic when creating them) and cannot be exceed a certain value as determined by the power level of the Minion. The only exception is Influence/Infamy, which cannot be bought for minions.

- Lesser: The Minion has 100 points to spread among its characteristics with no one characteristic higher than 30.
- Normal: The Minion has 175 points to spread among its characteristics with no one characteristic higher than 35.
- Greater: The Minion has 250 points to spread among its characteristics with no one characteristic higher than 40.

#### Random Characteristics

The default method of character creation requires players to determine the Characteristics of their Character by rolling a number of d10s and adding a modifier. Some players and GMs may prefer to use a similar method to determine the Characteristics of Minions, rather than the standard method of distributing points. Minions created under the method outlined above are likely to have relatively high values in two or three Characteristics deemed important to their main purpose, with minimal values for their other Characteristics. Some players may prefer a more "organic" method to determine a Minion's abilities. No matter how much a mercenary swordsman may neglect his mind in pursuit of his skill-at-arms, he is unlikely to have Intelligence 01—barring a very unfortunate mutation of the mind! In addition, the standard method of point-assignment works very well for players who have a firm idea of their Minion in mind, but some players may prefer to generate Characteristics randomly, which may provide inspiration. If the GM agrees (or insists), players may generate Minion Characteristics randomly, as shown below. 

This method is likely to result in higher characteristics overall, but also in a more even, natural distribution. This is offset by the fact that players do not have the opportunity to "optimise" their Minions' Characteristics using this method. To generate Characteristics, roll 2d10 for each Characteristic, and add 10 to the result on each for Lesser Minions, 15 for Minions, and 20 for Greater Minions. Before rolling, the player can choose up to two Characteristics to roll 3d10, dropping the lowest instead. For each Characteristic that gains this bonus, the player must choose another Characteristic that must roll 3d10 and drop the highest.

### Wounds and Movement

A Minion's Wounds and its Movement rate are both derived from its characteristics (though they may be altered later by the selection of certain Talents and Traits). A Minion's Movement is based on its Agility Bonus, in the same way as a PC. A Minion's Wounds are equal to twice its Toughness Bonus.

### Skills

Just like their masters, Minions have access to a number of Skills, often at varying levels of mastery. The number and ranks of these Skills is dependent on the Minions level of power. GMs may also restrict access to certain Skills for Minions (such as Lore or Operate Skills) if there is no reasonable way the Minion could have learned them. Unless the GM states otherwise, all Minions start with one Linguistics Skill of the players' choice, allowing it to communicate.

- Lesser: The Minion may choose 4 Skills at Rank 1.
- Normal: The Minion may choose 6 ranks of Skills (either 6 different Skills or fewer Skills at higher ranks) with no one skill higher than Rank 2.
- Greater: The Minion may choose 9 ranks of Skills (either 9 different Skills or fewer Skills at higher ranks) with no one skill higher than Rank 3.

### Talents

A Minion's abilities can be further enhanced by the addition of Talents giving it greater abilities with which to aid its master. Talents are a vital part of a Minion and like Traits really define its nature and whether it is a skilled orator, bookish scholar or expert assassin. The number and types of Talents a Minion can take is dependent on its level of power. When selecting Talents Minions must select their Talents following all the normal prerequisite rules, such as having the Psyker Trait for psychic Talents. GMs may also restrict access to certain Talents for Minions if it does not fit with their background. Finally, unless the GM specially determines otherwise, Minions cannot take any of the Minion Talents.

- Lesser: The Minion may choose 5 Talents none of which can be greater than Tier 1.
- Normal: The Minion may choose 7 Talents none of which can be greater than Tier 2.
- Greater: The Minion may choose 11 Talents up to and including Tier 3.

### Traits

More than anything else, Traits determine the true nature of a Minion and whether it is a ravening daemon, soulless machine or hulking beast. The number and types of Traits a Minion can take is dependent on the Minions level of power. Some Traits also have variable levels indicated by a number in parenthesis (X) denoting extra armour, multiple arms or similar things. When taking a trait the number of this variable depends on the power level of Minion as noted below and if a range of numbers is shown the player may choose a number from within that range. The only exception to this is the Unnatural Characteristic trait which may not have a variable number higher than the Minions associated characteristic bonus (in effect this trait may not more than double any one characteristic bonus). Minions which take the Daemonic trait also gain the Warp Instability trait. GMs may also restrict access to certain Traits for Minions if it does not fit with their background. In addition, if the Minion does not take the Size Trait, it is assumed to be Size (4), the size of an average human. (Note: that some of these Traits, denoted by '†', are unique to Minions and are found under Minion Traits).

#### Lesser

The Minion may select up to 3 Traits from the following list: 

Amphibious, Amorphous, Auto-stabilised, Bestial, Blind, Brutal Charge (1-2), Burrower (1-5), Crawler, Hoverer (1-4), Machine (1-2), Multiple Arms (1-2), Natural Armour (1-4), Natural Weapons, Quadruped, Size (1-10), Sonar Sense, Soul-bound, Stampede, Sturdy, Toxic (1), Unnatural Senses, Fanatic†, Parasite†, Sycophant†.

#### Normal

The Minion may select up to 5 Traits from the following list: 

Amphibious, Amorphous, Auto-stabilised, Bestial, Blind, Brutal Charge (1-3), Burrower (1-8), Crawler, Dark-sight, Deadly Natural Weapons, Fear (1), Hoverer (1-6), Machine (1-4), Multiple Arms (1-3), Natural Armour (1-6), Natural Weapons, Navigator, Psyker, Quadruped, Regeneration (1-2), Size (1-10), Sanctioned, Sonar Sense, Soul-bound, Stampede, Sturdy, Toxic (1-3), Undying, Unnatural Characteristic (1-3), Unnatural Senses, Fanatic†, Incorporeal, Monodevotant†, Mutant (1)†, Parasite†, Sycophant†.

#### Greater

The Minion may select up to 7 Traits from the following list: 

Amphibious, Amorphous, Auto-stabilised, Bestial, Blind, Brutal Charge (1-4), Burrower (1-10), Crawler, Daemonic, Dark-sight, Deadly Natural Weapons, Fear (1-2), Flyer (1-6), From Beyond, Hoverer (1- 10), Machine (1-6), Multiple Arms (1-4), Natural Armour (1-8), Natural Weapons, Navigator, Psyker, Quadruped, Regeneration (1-4), Sanctioned, Size (1-10), Sonar Sense, Soul-bound, Stampede, Stuff of Nightmares, Sturdy, Toxic (1-4), Undying, Unnatural Characteristic (1-4), Unnatural Senses, Warp Weapons, Fanatic†, Incorporeal, Monodevotant†, Mutant (1-3)†, Parasite†, Phase (Counts as 2 trait selections), Sycophant†.

#### Trading Traits

Some variables may be improved further by sacrificing the number of Traits a Minion could normally take. Players may further improve the Machine, Burrower, Flyer, Hoverer, and Natural Armour Traits in this way. For every trait they do not take they may increase a variable of one of these Traits by 1.

In addition, players may elect to trade a Trait selection for an additional Skill or Talent selection, following any other restrictions for the Minion level.

#### Psyker Minions

Minions that select the Psyker Trait may select the following, in place of a Talent

- New Psychic Power (Counts as Tier 1)
- Increase Psy Rating (Counts as Tier 3)

#### Navigator Minions

Minions that select the Navigator Trait may select the following, in place of a Talent

- New Navigator Power (Counts as Tier 1)
- Improve Power to Adept (Counts as Tier 2)
- Improve Power to Master (Counts as Tier 3)

### Equipment

The arming and armouring of Minions is largely the responsibility of their masters and a favoured Minion is usually one with the best weapons and equipment. Minions do bring some gear with them when they join the service of the character as determined by their level of power. Minions may only take Common Craftsmanship equipment.

- Lesser: The Minion may choose one suit of armour and one ranged weapon or one melee weapon with an Availability of Scarce or lower.
- Normal: The Minion may choose one suit of armour and two ranged weapons or two melee weapons (or one melee and one ranged weapon) with an Availability of Rare or lower. They may forgo taking one weapon to take another with an Availability of Very Rare instead.
- Greater: The Minion may choose one suit of armour with an Availability of Extremely Rare or lower (if power armour, it may only have one sub-system of the players' choice) and two ranged weapons and two melee weapons with an Availability of Very Rare or lower. They may forgo taking one weapon to take another with an Availability of Extremely Rare instead.

Players may forgo taking one of their weapons or armour to take other equipment with an equivalent Availability instead. At the GM's discretion Minions may also come with backup weapons (of Common availability or lower) and other small items and gear such as clothing, drugs, or tech, provided it is neither expensive or difficult to find. Players cannot choose equipment for their character's Minions which the Minion cannot use itself, nor can Minions give up their equipment readily when they enter play. Once a Minion is in the service of a character they have only what he gives them from this point on.

### Loyalty

The final aspect of creating a Minion is to determine its Loyalty. This is a measure of the Minion's devotion to the character and how readily it follows commands in their absence, or the lengths the Minion goes to in the character's name. A Minion's Loyalty is equal to the character's Fellowship. Whenever the character's Fellowship changes, for whatever reason, the Minion's Loyalty also changes.

## Using Minions

Minions differ from NPCs in that they are not controlled by the GM. Instead they are controlled by the player in the same way as his own character. In effect, a Minion represents an additional, weaker character run by the player, augmenting his abilities in the game and presenting him with different ways to overcome challenges. Minions are not, however, completely subservient to their character's will (even the most fanatical of followers are not completely infallible), and in certain situations may not do what the character wants (or they might just get it wrong). Whenever a player wants one of his character's Minions to either:

- Risk their life (combat does not count provided the character is fighting alongside them)
- Perform a task out of character (i.e., refrain from attacking a hated foe or from looting the dead)
- Follow orders in their absence (i.e., left on guard duty or sent off to kill someone)

The GM makes a Loyalty Test for the Minion. The GM rolls 1d100 against the Minions Loyalty, if the roll is equal or less that its Loyalty then the Minion performs exactly as the player wishes, if the roll is greater than its Loyalty then its nerve has failed or something has gone wrong and the GM takes control of the Minion for the remainder of the encounter.

### Improving Minions

Unlike Heretics, Minions do not improve as the character gains experience, and are set at the level at which they entered play, based on the Talent taken to acquire them. With the GM's permission, however, players may upgrade their Minions by upgrading the Talent associated with them. For instance, a Lesser Minion, acquired with the Lesser Minion of Chaos Talent, could become a Normal Minion if the player took the Minion of Chaos Talent. In this case the old Talent is either discarded (and its experience goes toward the new Talent) or the character can acquire a new Minion for it. In both cases characters must still follow all the Normal prerequisites for acquiring Talents. When this occurs the player goes back through Minion creation with his Minion and adds Characteristic Points, Skills, Talents, Traits and gear to make up the difference between its current level and its new level. For instance a Lesser Minion which became a Normal Minion would have another 70 points to spend on characteristics and could raise characteristics up to 30.

### Replacing Minions

It is likely that sooner or later a character's Minions are going to die (or he is going to grow bored with them and dismiss them from his service, possibly violently). When this happens the character does not lose the Talent used to gain the Minion. Instead he may create a new Minion to fill the slot left behind, in effect gaining a Minion for the Talent in the same manner as when he first took it. Replacing Minions is not an instant process, however, and unless there are exceptional circumstances, as determined by the GM (such as a loyal allied NPC already with the group and eager to serve), it can only take place in downtime between adventures (i.e., at some point the character would be able to go off and find a new Minion). Replacement Minions follow all the normal rules for Minions and are created in the same way and are subject to GM approval.

## Horde Minions

A Character with the Horde Minion Talent can create a Horde Minion. Horde Minions are created in the same manner as Lesser Minions, either using the standard method or the alternative random characteristics method Rather than generating a Wounds value, however, the Minion is given a Magnitude equal to one half of the Character's Influence. This represents the higher numbers of followers that an especially influential Character can attract, and possibly the higher quality attracted, as well. Though a Horde represents a number of individuals, it is treated in game terms as a single character, and likewise counts as a single Minion toward the Character's limit. If a Character's Influence changes during the course of a session, the Magnitude of his Horde Minion is adjusted to reflect the change, subject to the GM's discretion. An increase in Influence and corresponding increase in Magnitude does not necessarily represent additional individuals joining the Horde, though it certainly could if the Characters are in a populated area. It could just as readily represent an increase in the morale of the Character's followers, or even a blessing from the gods. If the GM determines an immediate change would be inappropriate for the circumstances, he may wish to defer the adjustment to Magnitude until a fitting opportunity, such as when the Characters return to their base of operations to gather more servants, or stage a ritual to bind additional souls to the Character's will, or simply until the end of the session. Horde Minions follow all the rules for Hordes, but additionally require certain considerations that do not typically apply to Minions. For instance, should the Characters procure a ride on a shuttlecraft with a capacity for a dozen or so passengers, it may be hard to fit a Magnitude 35 Horde of bloodthirsty cultists. Likewise, it may prove extremely difficult to covertly infiltrate an Imperial settlement with a pack of vicious xenos beasts in tow. Players and GMs should therefor consider these potential complications when introducing Horde Minions into a campaign. In the case of Hordes consisting of sentient beings, it is a good idea to nominate either a leader or representative member of the Horde to act as its "face" when interacting with characters or accepting orders from the Character. This representative member of the Horde may have a distinct personality and appearance, but is not treated as a separate character. Typically, this individual is assumed to survive any damage to the Horde's Magnitude, though that does not preclude non-fatal injuries.

### Horde Minions and Damage

A Horde's Magnitude is an abstraction of its durability and power, including factors such as the number of individuals, their morale and training, and their capacity to endure injury. Consequently, the reduction of a Horde's Magnitude due to damage sustained in combat does not represent the deaths of individuals on a one-for-one basis, but rather the reduction of the Horde's ability due to injuries, fatalities, and loss of morale. Due to the abstract nature of Magnitude damage, Horde Minions "heal" in a very different way to normal characters. In the aftermath of a fight, characters can attempt to restore a Horde's Magnitude in two ways, as both the bodies and spirit of the Horde can be treated. Once one of these methods has been successfully used to restore one or more points of Magnitude, it cannot be used again until the Horde's Magnitude has been changed through some other manner, such as further damage or the introduction of new members. Regardless of the methods used, a Horde's Magnitude cannot be raised above its normal value. A character with the Medicae Skill may perform first aid on the injured members of the Horde. Because this requires the treatment of numerous individuals, the time required for the Test must be left to the GM's discretion. However, it generally should take no less than one minute, and is simply too involved a process to be completed in the midst of combat. The character makes a Challenging (+0) Medicae Test. A successful Test restores Magnitude equal to the character's Intelligence Bonus, +1 for every two Degrees of Success. Unlike physical injuries, the morale and spirit of the Horde can only be significantly improved through the actions of the owning Character. The Horde's master attempts a Challenging (+0) Command, Charm, Deceive, or Intimidate Test. A successful Test restores an amount of Magnitude equal to the character's Influence Bonus, +1 for every Degree of Success, up to the Horde's starting Magnitude. This represents the Character rallying the troops with hymns, offering sweet inducements, cracking a whip menacingly, or convincing them that things are not as bad as they look. Hordes do not recover Magnitude over time in the way characters heal Damage. However, a Horde's Magnitude is restored during appropriate periods of downtime, in much the same way as an increase in Magnitude due to a rise in the Character's Influence.

## Superior Minions

Minions, typically, are a cut above the assorted hirelings, mercenaries, and servants whom a Character may enlist. Nevertheless, Minions have their limitations, notably the fact that they cannot improve their abilities past the levels permitted by the Greater Minion Talent. Eventually, even a Greater Minion may outlive its utility as a Character grows in power, for the greatest servants of Chaos are nothing if not fickle masters. The Superior Minion Talent grants the Character a powerful Minion whose abilities can improve over time, reflecting the Character's own advancement. A Superior Minion may represent a particularly skilled or favoured servant, a dangerous ally, or even an almost-trusted partner. Unlike other Minions, Superior Minions can improve their Characteristics, Skills, and Talents. Superior Minions are unique in that they can obtain and spend Experience Points in much the same way as Characters. When a player first selects the Superior Minion Talent, he creates the Superior Minion following the same process as if he were creating a Greater Minion. A Superior Minion counts toward the limit on the number of Minions the Character can have. Unlike other Minion Talents, the Superior Minion Talent cannot be taken multiple times; a Character may only have a single Superior Minion at a time. Superior Minions have a Loyalty value just as other Minions, which is tested against under the same circumstances. As powerful as they may be, Superior Minions follow all the normal rules for Minions, with the exceptions noted below. Each time the Character gains the Minion Improvement Talent, when creating the Superior Minion or at a later time, his Superior Minion gains 500 xp to spend. A Superior Minion's xp total may never exceed 50% of the controlling Character's xp; any excess Experience Points, from any source, are lost.

### Advancing Superior Minions

Superior Minions generally gain xp when a Character purchases the Minion Improvement Talent, and perhaps as a reward for game play. Regardless of the source, Minions may spend xp in the same manner as Characters, with a few clarifications and additional limitations. Like Characters, Superior Minions may purchase Characteristic Advancements at the Simple, Intermediate, Trained, and Expert levels, as well as Skills and Talents. Also like Characters, the Experience cost for an Advancement is determined by the Minion's Alignment and that of the Characteristic, Skill, or Talent in question.

#### Superior Minions and Alignment

When created, a Superior Minion's Alignment is the same as the controlling Character; e.g., an Unaligned Character's Superior Minion is Unaligned. Any time a Character checks his Alignment (usually after gaining 10 Corruption Points), the Superior Minion must also check its Alignment. If the Superior Minion's Alignment changes to that of a god only Allied to the Character's own patron (excluding Unaligned), the Character reduces his Influence by 1d5, representing a loss of face in the eyes of his god's other followers, and perhaps the god itself. If the Superior Minion's Alignment changes to that of an Opposed god, the Minion leaves the Character's service and the Character reduces his Influence by 1d5+5. The specifics of how the Minion departs are up to the GM, and could range from stealing a vehicle in the dark of night to making an attempt on the Character's life. Tracking down and taking revenge on a treacherous former Minion could form the basis for an adventure, or even a Compact, allowing the Character to regain some of the Influence he lost in the first place! Normally, Skills and Talents selected when a Superior Minion is created do not count towards Alignment. With the GM's permission, however, a player may choose for his Minion's starting Talents and Skills to count toward Alignment, in which case the decision must be made when the Minion is created and all Skill and Talents thereafter count towards Alignment. This option cannot be chosen if the Minion's Skills and Talents would result in it being Aligned to a god Opposed to the Character's own. Certain Superior Minions are, by their very nature, bound to a particular Chaos god, as is the case with Daemons. When created, the GM may deem that a Superior Minion is permanently Aligned to a specific Chaos god, or permanently Unaligned. In this case, the Minion's Alignment cannot be Opposed to the Character's, and will always determine the xp cost for Advancements. Such a Minion cannot purchase an Advancement Aligned to another god if it would surpass the number of Advancements Aligned to its own patron.

#### Marks of Chaos

With the GM's permission, a Superior Minion who meets the requirements (20 Advances along a single path of Devotion) may be eligible to receive a Mark of Chaos, with all the benefits entailed. Unlike Characters, the Mark of Chaos is not free, and the Minion must spend 500 xp to obtain it.

### Replacing Superior Minions

As is the case with other Minions, a Character may replace a Superior Minion who has been killed or otherwise left the Character's service at an appropriate point, such as the downtime between adventures; although when dealing with such an important Minion, GMs and players may wish to incorporate the introduction of the Superior Minion into play, or even as a focal point of a session. When creating a replacement Superior Minion, the Minion has an amount of xp available to spend based on the value of the Character's Minion Improvement Talent, if he has selected it more than once. To lose a Superior Minion represents a major blow to a Character's resources, and a potential opportunity for his enemies. Should a Superior Minion die in combat or otherwise perish in the course of his service to the Character, the Character loses 1d5 Influence. This penalty may be waived if circumstances warrant, at the GM's discretion. For instance, the GM may decide that a Character does not lose any Influence after sacrificing his Minion as part of a major Ritual in the name of his god.
