# Advancement

## Aptitudes

These represent tasks or abilities for which a character has a natural affinity, and can learn with greater ease than others\. Characteristic, skill, and talent advances in the game have aptitudes linked to them, usually two \(though especially rare abilities might have only one\)\. Those advances sharing a character's aptitudes are easier for that character to learn, and thus cost fewer experience points to purchase\. If a character shares one aptitude with an advance, he gains a small discount to purchasing it, and if he shares two aptitudes with the advance he gains a large discount\. Players can still purchase advances for which they have no shared aptitudes, but these are typically very expensive\. All characters are considered to possess the 'General' aptitude

Note that if during creation a character gains the same aptitude from different sources, he does not gain it twice\. He instead chooses and gains a Characteristic\-based aptitude that he does not already have\.

## Characteristic Advances

A characteristic advance represents a natural improvement to a character's body or mind\. When a player purchases an advance in a characteristic, he adds \+5 to that characteristic permanently\. Characteristic advances are divided into five progression levels:

- Simple: A small fulfilment of the character's potential\.
- Intermediate: A significant and noticeable improvement of the character's capabilities\.
- Trained: A measure of the character's improvement beyond most around him\.
- Proficient: Active, focused effort upon improving the character's prowess\.
- Expert: The limit of a character's natural abilities

As players set about increasing their characters' characteristics, they must progress through each of the progression levels in turn\. This begins with Simple and ends at Expert, using the prices on the Characteristic Advances Table\.

The costs for characteristic advances are cumulative\. For instance, a player could not simply pay 500 xp for a \+10 increase for a characteristic he has one aptitude matched with\. Instead, the player is required to buy the Simple advance for 250 xp first, and then pay the 500 xp for the Intermediate advance\.

### Characteristic Advance Costs
Matching Aptitudes| Simple| Intermediate| Trained| Proficient| Expert 
------------------|------|------------|--------|----------|--------
Two               |100 xp|250 xp      |500 xp  |750 xp    |1250 xp 
One               |250 xp|500 xp      |750 xp  |1,000 xp  |1,500 xp
Zero              |500 xp|750 xp      |1,000 xp|1,500 xp  |2,500 xp

## Skill Advances

Player Characters learn new skills or improve existing skills by selecting skill advances\. The xp cost of skill advances depends on how many aptitudes the character has in common with that skill\. These advances are divided into four ranks of progression levels, which are as follows:

- Known \(rank 1\): The character can use the skill without the â€“20 penalty for untrained skills\.
- Trained \(rank 2\): The character receives \+10 on all skill tests when using this skill\.
- Experienced \(rank 3\): The character receives a \+20 bonus on all skill tests when using this skill\. This bonus replaces the bonus for being Trained\.
- Veteran \(rank 4\): The character receives a \+30 bonus to all skill tests when using this skill\. This bonus replaces the bonus for being Experienced in this skill\.

When improving a skill, a character must progress through each of the levels in turn, starting with Known and ending with Veteran\. So, for example, players cannot choose to pay for the Trained skill advance for their character without first purchasing the Known skill advance\. Note that characters might have received the Known or Trained skill advance already through character creation\.

### Skill Advance Costs
Matching Aptitudes| Known (Rank 1)| Trained (Rank 2)| Experienced (Rank 3)| Veteran (Rank 4)
------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------
Two               |100 xp        |200 xp          |300 xp              |400 xp          
One               |200 xp        |400 xp          |600 xp              |800 xp          
Zero              |300 xp        |600 xp          |900 xp              |1,200 xp        

## Talent Purchases

Talents are enhancements that permit a character to use his natural abilities in new fashions\. These can provide a situational bonus to the use of a skill or characteristic, or provide specific and unusual ways for a character to take advantage of his equipment\. As with characteristics and skills, talents have aptitudes associated with them \(usually two, but some might have only one\), and are discounted based on how many a character shares\. Talents are also divided into three tiers, representing their relative power levels and the amount of xp needed to purchase them\. Talents also often have prerequisites that must be met before they can be purchased, no matter what tier they belong to\.

### Talent Advance Costs
Matching Aptitudes| Tier One| Tier Two| Tier Three
------------------|--------|--------|----------
Two               |200 xp  |300 xp  |400 xp    
One               |300 xp  |450 xp  |600 xp    
Zero              |600 xp  |900 xp  |1,200 xp  

### Taking Talents Multiple Times

Some talents can be taken multiple times, which is noted in the talent's description\. There are only a few of these talents; the most prominent is Sound Constitution, which increases a Player Character's wounds each time it is taken\. When taking these talents multiple times, the player simply pays the experience cost each time\. It should be noted, however, that some talents that can be taken multiple times have a hard limit, indicating the maximum number of times they can be purchased\.

#### Specialist Talents

Some talents are designated Specialist talents\. These talents can be selected more than once, with a different specialty each time\.

## Elite Advances

Elite advances are specialised advances that set a character apart significantly\. Many elite advances can only be acquired under special circumstances, and those that can be obtained through play represent large, fundamental changes to a character\. To obtain an elite advance, a character must have the permission of the GM, meet all of the prerequisites, and spend the specified amount of experience\. See Elite Advances for more information.
