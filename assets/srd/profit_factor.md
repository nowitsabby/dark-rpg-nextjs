# Profit Factor

A Rogue Trader's wealth and power are vast indeed, stretching across the stars themselves\. In a Rogue Trader's time, even the least of the dynasties will touch dozens of worlds and shape the fate of their civilizations, transforming the lives of millions and altering the fortunes of entire star systems\. Even in a galactic empire that sprawls across tens of thousands of light years, a Rogue Trader has power that only a handful of humanity can imagine\.

To represent this mighty wealth and influence, the Rogue Trader game uses Profit Factor\. This value, more than anything else, is a measure of the Explorers' rising or failing fortunes\. As the PCs' Profit Factor grows so to will their access to rare and powerful items, unique retainers, and exclusive organisations\. Beyond personal power, Profit Factor also maps the rise of the Explorers' dynasty and over time will allow them to acquire legions of elite warriors, sprawling solar settlements, and even the favour of Imperial Adeptus\. Table Profit and Power provides an example of Profit Factor and corresponding power within the Imperium\.

Profit Factor does not, however, represent any one thing, but rather is a combination of all the aspects of wealth and power at the Explorers' command\. This means that Profit Factor is all at once the amount of coins in their coffers, their standing in Imperial society, and their complex web of loans, favours, and debts\. As such, Profit Factor is used whenever the Rogue Trader wishes to exert the power of his dynasty or expand his dominion within the Imperium\. In this section, we will cover the two most common uses of Profit Factor— Acquisition and Influence

#### Acquisition

Profit Factor is used by the Explorers to determine which equipment, resources, and rights they may acquire and maintain\.

#### Influence

Profit Factor can also be used by the Explorers to influence Imperial society, call in favours, and enforce loyalty among their followers\.

## Profit Factor vs Influence

Profit Factor represents the wealth and power of an organization, not an individual's reputation or influence\. To represent this, parties using Profit Factor may use it in place of their own Influence when invoking that organisation. Doing so allows easier access to many things, but failure and faux pas reflect on the entire group instead of just the individual\. An individual may always use their personal Influence instead, and Profit Factor may not be substituted for Influence for purposes of Talent prerequisites.

The vast power of a Rogue Trader organization means that the economics of scale apply to their Acquisition checks\. In addition to any other modifiers, apply the Scale modifier appropriate for the amount of goods being sought\. Exceptions to this rule include Unique and Near Unique items, as well as Starship Components\.

| Scale | Modifier | Example  |
|---|---|---|
| **Negligible** | +30 | Single Man  |
| **Trivial** | +20 | Squad (3–5)  |
| **Minor** | +10 | Platoon (10–30)  |
| **Standard** | +0 | Company (50–100)  |
| **Major** | –10 | Regiment (500–1,000)  |
| **Significant** | –20 | Division (2,000–5,000)  |
| **Vast** | –30 | Army (10,000+) |


## Starting Profit Factor

A new Rogue Trader group begins play with a Profit Factor equal to the amount generated using Table Starting Profit Factor and Ship Points plus any additional the modifiers obtained during character creation\. This amount generally places the group on a level with a planetary noble house, a free trader cartel, or a minor multi\-world Ministorum sect\.

### Starting Profit Factor and Ship Points

__Roll \(1D10\)__|__Profit Factor__|__Ship Points__|__Example__
---|---|---|---
1|60|30|Although the dynasty does not command a powerful starship, it possesses great resources\.
2–3|50|40|A good ship and a wealthy purse promise great things for this dynasty\.
4–7|40|50|The Rogue Trader dynasty is a fresh, new player on the galactic stage, garnering attention both fair and foul\.
8–9|30|60|A dynasty whose power is on the wane, but may yet recover\.
10|20|70|The Rogue Trader dynasty was once a great and powerful flame, now only a glimmer of its former glory\.

## Gaining and Losing Profit Factor

Profit Factor rises and falls as a result of the actions of the Explorers\. There are three things that affect Profit Factor: Awards, Endeavours, and Misfortunes\.

### Awards

These are a bonus that the GM gives the Explorers as a reward for their actions during play—in much the same way as Experience Points\. Awards only ever raise the Explorers' Profit Factor by a single point\.

### Endeavours

Unlike Awards, Endeavours are major undertakings by the PCs, involving such tasks as settling worlds, mining star systems, and charting warp routes\. Endeavours are the main way in which Profit Factor is increased, and completing a substantial Endeavour can significantly raise the group's score\.

### Misfortunes

Profit Factor is not normally expended when it is used—it represents wealth and power far too great to be dented by the purchase of simple equipment or by commanding the favour of local merchants\. It can, however, be reduced by Misfortunes\. These are events that inevitably befall the Explorers through the course of their adventures and enterprises and need to be countered by Awards and Endeavours or dealt with as required\.

##### Misfortunes Chance

| d100        | Result | Profit Factor Lost |
|---|---|---|
| 01-49       | Fate smiles upon the Rogue Trader: no Misfortune | — |
| 50-65       | Nuisance Misfortune | 1 |
| 66-90       | Grim Misfortune | 2 |
| 90-00       | Calamitous Misfortune | 1d5 |

#### Random Misfortunes

1d100 |Misfortune Details
------|-------------------------
01–05 |Administratum tithe clerks files for an assessment, empowered by their superiors to bleed the Rogue Trader a little more in the name of the God-Emperor.
06–10 |Departmento Munitorum officers have come into evidence that the Rogue Trader has siphoned materiel from their Port Wander vaults, and are pressing upon him with the full force of Imperial law. The evidence is all false, of course, but what motivation is behind this outrage?
11–15 |A setback in the tending of coffers: ledgers are errant and Thrones are lost. Is this a careless accident or hidden embezzlement?
16–20 |A dire plague is abroad, and the merest threat of it is enough for quarantines and panic. Even places unaffected by the plague are disrupted by the havoc it wreaks many worlds away.
21–25 |An accident fells many skilled hirelings, leaving too few possessing a rare talent in a vital position. Is it really an accident, however?
26–30 |A corruption takes hold in one of the Rogue Trader's interests: cultists of the Dark Gods, a wayward Imperial Cult, or an unruly Crew Brotherhood act to sow toil and make trouble.
31–35 |Zealots amongst the Rogue Trader's interests are stirring up the workers to make pilgrimage to the shrine worlds of the Drusus Marches. Toil is slackening, and servants are slipping away or rising up to petition the Rogue Trader to grant them leave to be pilgrims.
36–40 |An ambitious Magos demands a new compact of tech-ritual and prayer, one much more favourable to Machine Cult coffers.
41–45 |A Grand Assemblage of the Omnissiah's Grace is called by an Archmagos, and all Tech-Adepts pledged to the Rogue Trader are much withdrawn, the Machine Cult distant from what its Magi perceive as trivial responsibilities towards compacts and Imperial brethren.
46–50 |The sub-sector trade market enters one of its doleful periods of crisis, loss, and hand-wringing. Merchant houses suffer and cut short their endeavours.
51–55 |A new dictate of mercantile law has come to the Drusus Marches from Scintilla, and the upheaval that attends it is dire indeed. Many important guilders are ruined or driven to other lines of commerce, and many compacts are now worthless.
56–60 |Pirates from Iniquity, thought broken and scattered, strike at the Rogue Trader's interests, assaulting vessels and raiding resource worlds.
61–65 |The vile Ork emerges to loot and destroy the Rogue Trader's interests in the Koronus Expanse.
66–70 |Calixian leaders of a great Imperial organisation suddenly display far less respect for Rogue Traders. This change of opinion will spread from the top down and out into the broader Imperial class if not stopped.
71–75 |The Rogue Trader is supposed by some to be an adherent of one of the unseemly Imperial cults of Footfall, placing him well on the outside of civilised Imperial society in Port Wander and the Drusus Marches.
76–80 |An influential noble or powerful Imperial hierarch chooses to denigrate the Rogue Trader, and all the sycophants follow that lead. This disrespect will spread from the top down into the broader Imperial class if not stopped.
81–85 |The Rogue Trader is rumoured to have died. Administratum adepts now move slowly and inexorably towards the legal annulment of his Warrant of Trade.
86–90 |Adeptus Arbites find, or are provided with, evidence of rebellion fomented amongst the Rogue Trader's hirelings. A lord perceived to hold an unruly estate will suffer in the eyes of his peers.
91–95 |A rival's hatred for the Rogue Trader becomes well known, and many lesser figures prefer not to become involved with either side whilst such an enmity exists. Now, the rival has begun to strike openly against the Rogue Trader's interests.
96–100|The Rogue Trader receives an unexplained and unexpected visitation from highly ranked members of the Inquisition, an event guaranteed to harm his prospects when word gets out.

#### Overcoming Misfortunes

When a Misfortune occurs, the Explorers are faced with two choices: they can deal with it or ignore it. Ignoring a Misfortune means that the Profit Factor lost to it is permanent, and at the GM's discretion, there may be other consequences as well, as plagues are allowed to run rampant, charges are gathered against the Explorers, or worlds slowly fall into chaos. If the Explorers choose to deal with the Misfortune, then they must allocate time and resources to combating it—perhaps at the expense of current Endeavours or missions. It then falls to the GM to decide if they have acted both swiftly enough and decisively enough to overcome the Misfortune. If they have, then he should allow them to recover any Profit Factor lost to the Misfortune.

## Influence Tests

An Influence Test is a way for the Explorers to use their Profit Factor to sway powerful organisations or gain favour from the wealthy and powerful of the Imperium\. Naturally, the higher their Profit Factor the more likely people are to take notice of them\. To make an Influence Test, the Explorers must make a contest of their Profit Factor versus the Profit Factor of the person or organisation they wish to influence\. This contest is treated as an Opposed Test\. The GM can modify this roll as usual\. For every degree that the Explorers beat their opponent on this Opposed Test, the GM can grant them a \+5 on all Interaction Skill Tests with the organisation or person for the remainder of their immediate dealings \(the bonus lasts until the end of the current encounter or even longer at the GM's discretion\)\. For every degree their opponent beats them, however, a –5 penalty on Interaction Skill Tests is levied instead\. Alternatively, the GM can use an Influence Test as a one off roll to try to convince the person or organisation to grant the Explorers a favour, free passage, or give them some important information\.
