# Game Dice 

Dice rolls use only ten\-sided polyhedral dice\. These are used for three different types of rolls: the d10 roll, the d5 roll, and the percentile \(d100\) roll\. 

### d10 Roll 

When required to make a d10 roll, the player or GM rolls a number of ten\-sided dice indicated before the “d” and adds them together to create the final result\. For example, a 3d10 roll would consist of three dice rolled and added together \(for a total result between 3 and 30\)\. If there is no number before the “d,” it is assumed to be a 1\. 

### d5 Roll

This follows the same process as above, but the player or GM divides the result on each ten\-sided die by two and rounds up, to create a result between 1 and 5 for each die\. 

### Percentile \(d100\) Roll

When required to make a percentile roll, the player or GM generates a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two ten\-sided dice\. One \(designated before the roll\) is the tens digit; the other is the ones digit\. Two 0s represents 100\. These tests are commonly abbreviated as “d100” in the text\. 

Often the rules can call for a dice roll with a fixed modifier to gain a value, such as 2d10\+5 or 1d5–1\. In this case, the result from the dice is added or subtracted to the fixed modifier to gain the final result\. Note that if the final result is less than zero then it counts as zero \(unless a rule particularly states otherwise\)\. Sometimes, a special rule can allow a player to re\-roll the dice\. When this happens, the second result must be used, even if it is worse than the original result\. 

### Rounding and Multiplying 

If a fraction is generated when dividing, unless specified otherwise round the result up, even if the fraction is less than one\-half\. When two or more multipliers apply to a value, add them together to form a single multiple, with each multiplier beyond the first adding 1 less than its value to the first multiplier\. Thus a double \(x2\) and a double \(x2\) applied to the same number results in a triple \(x3, as 2 \+ 1 = 3\)\.
