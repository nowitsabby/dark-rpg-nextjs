# Characteristics 

Characteristics represent a character's raw potential and natural physical and mental gifts, such as her strength, agility, intelligence, and skill with melee and ranged weaponry. Characteristic values range from 1 to 100 and the higher the characteristic is, the more raw talent the character has in that particular area. There are ten characteristics, and each represents a different mental or physical attribute. Each is listed briefly here, with its common abbreviation \(Willpower, for example, is often abbreviated as “WP” in game text\). 

Characteristics are important to a character for a number of reasons, not least of which is that they reflect a character's ability to succeed at particular actions. Characteristics are modified by external factors such as skills, and can be improved in a number of temporary and permanent ways. Since characteristics set the base target number for all tests, high characteristics are always more favourable than low characteristics. For more information on how to generate characteristics and how they relate to character generation, see Character Creation. 

### Characteristic Bonuses 

In addition to its numerical value, each characteristic has a characteristic bonus, a number equal to the “tens” digit of that characteristic. For example, a character with a Strength of 42 would have a Strength bonus of 4. 

When a characteristic bonus is abbreviated in text, it uses the normal abbreviation listed for each characteristic with an additional “B” at the end \(the Agility bonus, for example, would be abbreviated as “AgB” in text\). 

### Weapon Skill \(WS\) 

Weapon Skill measures a character's competence in all forms of close\-quarters combat. Characters with high Weapon Skill values are excellent warriors, renowned with a chainsword or even their bare hands. 

### Ballistic Skill \(BS\) 

Ballistic Skill measures a character's accuracy with all forms of ranged weapons. A high Ballistic Skill indicates a character is an excellent marksman, someone to be rightly feared in a fire\-fight or shootout. 

### Strength \(S\) 

Strength measures a character's muscle and physical power. A high Strength characteristic value allows a character to lift heavier objects and punch a foe harder.

### Toughness \(T\) 

Toughness measures a character's health, stamina, and resistance. Exceptionally Tough characters can shrug off otherwise damaging weapon hits and better withstand poisonous attacks. 

### Agility \(Ag\) 

This measures a character's quickness, reflex, and poise. High Agility can allow a character to manipulate delicate machinery with finesse, or keep her footing when crossing treacherous terrain. This characteristic also determines a character's movement rate; the higher the Agility bonus, the farther she can move each turn. 

### Intelligence \(Int\) 

Intelligence measures a character's acumen, reason, and general knowledge. A character with a strong Intelligence value can recall huge volumes of data, correlate esoteric clues, or determine if an ancient archaeotech relic is genuine or not. 

### Perception \(Per\) 

This measures a character's awareness and the acuteness of her senses. A character who has a high Perception value can pick out a stray bolter shell casing left amidst an underhive morass, or tell when someone is being deceitful. 

### Willpower \(WP\) 

Willpower measures a character's mental strength and resilience. High Willpower allows a character to exert control over a crowd of near\-rioting hab workers or interrogate a captured heretic. It is also often used when wielding and resisting psychic powers.

### Fellowship \(Fel\) 

Fellowship measures a character's persuasiveness, ability to lead, and force of personality. Having a strong Fellowship makes for a character who can ingratiate herself into a gathering of suspicious forge menials or make skilled trades with wily vendors. 

### Influence/Infamy \(Inf\) 

This measures a character's connections, reputation, and resources. High Influence can allow a character to quickly summon the aid of local military forces to her side, or arrange for fast transit to another star system. Unlike the other characteristics, Influence changes only as a character performs actions: it would decrease should she fail a mission in a highly visible manner, for example, or increase after she successfully rescues a kidnapped planetary governor. In the case heretic or otherwise "Evil" characters, this characteristic is called Infamy instead. The methods used to obtain it may vary, but it functions identically
