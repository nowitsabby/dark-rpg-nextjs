title: Movement

# Movement 

Movement is an important factor, as Players are likely to be in constant motion as they investigate heresies, ferret out clues, and \(often violently\) quash those who would imperil Mankind through purposeful direction or foolhardy action\. There are two different methods of keeping time—narrative time and structured time—and each has its own unique rules regarding movement\. 

## Structured and Narrative Time 

During structured time, which typically involves combat, a character may take a specific action during a round to move at one of four speeds: Half Move, Full Move, Charge, or Run\. The number of metres a character moves at these various speeds is dictated by his Agility bonus, and can be further modified through some talents or traits\. 

### Movement Speed in Structured Time
__AgB__|__Half Move__|__Full Move__|__Charge__|__Run__
---|---------|---------|------|---
0  |1/2m      |1m        |2m     |3m  
1  |1m        |2m        |3m     |6m  
2  |2m        |4m        |6m     |12m 
3  |3m        |6m        |9m     |18m 
4  |4m        |8m        |12m    |24m 
5  |5m        |10m       |15m    |30m 
6  |6m        |12m       |18m    |36m 
7  |7m        |14m       |21m    |42m 
8  |8m        |16m       |24m    |48m 
9  |9m        |18m       |27m    |54m 
10 |10m       |20m       |30m    |60m 

During narrative time, when a character is not actively involved in combat or some other all\-consuming, time\-sensitive task, knowing how far a character can move in a given amount of time is often still important to the story\. Narrative time movement describes the standard speeds a character can move at a normal pace under ideal circumstances\. Environment and terrain, discussed below, can affect these speeds, helping or hindering a character as he travels\. 

### Movement Speed in Narrative Time
__AgB__|__Per Minute__|__Per Hour__|__Per Day__
---|----------|--------|-------
0  |12m       |0.75km  |7km    
1  |24m       |1.5km   |15km   
2  |48m       |3km     |30km   
3  |72m       |4km     |40km   
4  |96m       |6km     |60km   
5  |120m      |7km     |70km   
6  |144m      |9km     |90km   
7  |168m      |10km    |100km  
8  |192m      |12km    |120km  
9  |216m      |13km    |130km  
10 |240m      |14km    |140km  

### Narrative Movement and Terrain 

Terrain conditions affect how quickly a character can cover ground during narrative time\. Slogging through a field full of waist\-deep snow is much harder than walking across the broad flagstone paved courtyard\. When moving through thick foliage, dense crowds, soft sand, deep mud, and other similar difficult terrain, a character's Movement is halved\. Furthermore, the Game Master determines what, if any, modifiers apply to narrative time due to the environment\. 

### Hurrying in Narrative Time 

During an Acolyte's investigations, time is often of the essence, for the fate of worlds can hang in the balance\. When moving in narrative time, a character can hurry to double his narrative time Movement\. While hurrying, a character suffers a –10 penalty to Perception\-based tests due to the distraction of his haste\. A character can hurry for a number of consecutive hours equal to his Toughness bonus before he starts to feel its effects\. At the end of this period, he must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Toughness test or suffer 1 level of Fatigue\. Additionally, at the end of each consecutive period of the same length for which he hurries, he must make another Toughness test with a cumulative –10 penalty or suffer 1 level of Fatigue\. For example, he suffers a –10 penalty to his Toughness test at the end of the second period, a –20 after the third, and so forth\. 

### Running in Narrative Time 

When moving in narrative time, a character can run up to triple his narrative time movement\. While running, a character suffers a –20 penalty to Perception\-based tests\. At the end of the first hour for which he runs, a character must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Toughness or suffer 1 level of Fatigue\. At the end of each subsequent hour, he must make another Toughness test with a cumulative –10 penalty or suffer 1 level of Fatigue\.

## Forced Marching 

While the standard time for marching is ten hours in a day, nothing is stopping characters from continuing past that time\. After a ten hour march, a character can safely press on for a number of hours equal to his Toughness bonus\. At the end of the first hour after the end of that period, the character must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Toughness test or suffer 1 level of Fatigue, and must repeat this test with a cumulative –10 penalty at the end of each consecutive hour of marching thereafter\. Fatigue gained from forced marching is removed at a rate of one level per two hours of rest\. 

## Movement and Environment 

The rates as listed in above assume a relatively clear and uncluttered setting\. This is rarely the case, however, as few combats take place on a clear day in empty hive habways or open fields, and there can be any number of obstacles present to hinder a character's movement\. Refuse strewn corridors, deep snow, thick fog, deep, soft sand, dense underbrush—these are but a few examples of the conditions that can complicate navigation\. In such conditions, a character's structured time Movement rate is halved \(rounding up\)\. 

In structured time, if a character takes a Run or Charge action in a treacherous environment, he must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Agility test\. Failure means he falls Prone at a point in his movement determined by the GM and based on the degrees of failure\. The difficulty of this test can be further modified at the GM's discretion based on any number of factors\. 

### Treacherous Environment Agility Modifiers
__Condition__    |__Modifier__
-------------|--------
Fog or Smoke |+10     
Mud          |+0

Zero Gravity |–20

Tremors      |–20     

## Climbing 

There are many times in a character's experience when the best way to reach a destination or bypass an obstacle is by climbing\. Clambering over a fence, scaling a city wall, descending into a crevasse, and scaling up a wall to an ideal rooftop sniper position are all instances where climbing is required\. Climbing is divided into two general categories depending on nature of the terrain: simple climbs and sheer surfaces\. 

### Simple Climbs 

Simple climbs include low walls, steep hills, tall piles of rubble, trees, or anything else that requires effort and concentration but no real skill to accomplish\. Any character with his hands free can automatically accomplish a simple climb as long as he takes his time and is not being distracted \(while taking fire, for example\)\. 

If a character is hurrying, being chased, under fire, or otherwise distracted, he needs to make a Challenging \(\+0\) Strength or Athletics test to perform a simple climb\. With one degree of success, the character completes his climb at a rate of one\-half his Half Move speed\. For each further degree of success, the character climbs an additional metre\. If he fails the test, the character falls from his starting climbing position\. At his discretion, the Game Master can adjust the difficulty of the climb to account for any other factors that he deems appropriate\. Some types of climb, such as ascending a sturdy ladder or steep flight of stairs, are so simple that no test should be necessary, even when distracted\. 

### Sheer Surfaces 

Many surfaces are beyond the means of ordinary characters to climb, and often require specialised training and equipment\. A sheer cliff with overhangs and no handholds, an icy crevasse, the walls of buildings, or the massive flying buttresses of a hive city are examples of such technical climbs, and attempting a climb like this requires a Hard \(–10\) Athletics test\. With one degree of success, the character completes his climb at a rate of one\-half his Half Move speed\. For each further degree of success, the character climbs an additional metre\. If he fails, the character falls from his starting climbing position\. Specialised gear items such as grapnels and clip harnesses add bonuses to Athletics tests and are discussed further in Armoury\. 

#### Abseiling 

If a character needs to descend a sheer surface quickly, he can attempt abseiling as opposed to climbing down\. Abseiling requires climbing gear, a drop harness, or at least a good, stout line, and requires a Challenging \(\+0\) Agility test\. With one degree of success, the character descends at a rate of 10 metres per round, plus an additional metre for every additional degree of success\. With one degree of failure, the descent rate is reduced to 5 metres per round\. Failure by two or more degrees requires the character to make a Challenging \(\+0\) Strength test or lose his grip—and if he is not wearing a drop harness or otherwise secured, he falls from his starting climbing position\.

## Jumping and Leaping 

A jump is a controlled vertical ascent or descent wherein a character attempts to either jump as high as he can, or jump safely down from an elevated surface without taking damage\. If a character is pushed from a ledge, or is otherwise not in control of his descent, he is not jumping, but falling\. A leap is a horizontal jump by which a character attempts to cover as much ground as possible\. Both jumping and leaping can benefit from a running start, and both require a Full Action\. 

### Standing Vertical Jumps 

An average character can jump, from a standing position, roughly one half\-metre straight up as measured from the ground to the bottom of his feet\. Jumping distance depends as much on a character's body mass as it does on his Agility or Strength, so this distance tends to vary only slightly among characters\. A character can jump up to reach an overhead item like a ledge or other handhold that is as high as his own height plus about one metre for average arm length and an additional half\-metre for the average standing jump\. A test is not usually required for such a jump, though the GM can call for an Agility test if the character is carrying heavy items, for example\. Pulling oneself up onto a grabbed ledge requires a Challenging \(\+0\) Strength test\. A character can attempt to safely jump down short distances\. When a character attempts this, he must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Agility test\. If he succeeds, he can safely drop a number of metres equal to his Agility bonus, plus 1 metre per degree of success he scored on the test\. If he fails, he falls Prone and suffers falling damage for the full distance upon impact\. If he succeeds but does not score enough degrees of success to fall safely, he falls Prone and suffers falling damage for a number of metres equal to the distance he fell minus his Agility bonus\. 

### Running Vertical Jumps 

With a running start of at least four metres in a straight line, a character can increase the height of his jumps\. At the end of his running jump, the character must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Agility test\. If he succeeds, he adds a number of metres equal to half of his Strength bonus \(rounded up\), plus another half\-metre for each additional degree of success beyond the first, to his normal vertical jump distance\. If the character fails the test, he stumbles and must succeed on an additional Challenging \(\+0\) Agility test or fall Prone\. Either outcome ends the character's turn\. For every four additional metres beyond the first four that the character runs before making the jump, he receives a \+10 bonus to his Agility test \(to a maximum of \+30\)

### Standing Horizontal Leaps 

To make a Standing Horizontal Leap, a character must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Agility test\. If he succeeds, he leaps a number of metres equal to his Strength bonus, plus another half\-metre for every additional degree of success he scores beyond the first\. If he fails, the character only leaps a number of metres equal to half of his Strength bonus \(rounded up\); each additional degree of failure beyond the first reduces this distance by another half metre \(to a minimum of one\-half metre\)\. If it is important, the height attained during a leap is equal to one quarter the distance leapt in metres, rounded up\. 

### Running Horizontal Leaps 

As with Running Vertical Jumps, to make a Running Horizontal Leap a character must have a running start of at least four metres in a straight line\. At the end of the movement, the character makes a Challenging \(\+0\) Agility test\. If he succeeds, he leaps a number of metres equal his Strength bonus, plus another half\-metre for each additional degree of success beyond the first\. If he fails, the character only leaps a number of metres equal to half of his Strength bonus \(rounded up\); each additional degree of failure beyond the first reduces the distance leapt by another half metre \(to a minimum of one\-half metre\)\. For every four additional metres beyond the first four that the character runs before making the leap, he receives a \+10 bonus to his Agility test \(to a maximum of \+30\)\. If it is important, the height attained during a leap is equal to one quarter the distance leapt in metres rounded up\.

## Swimming 

Under ideal circumstances a character, does not need to make a tests to swim, but ideal circumstances are rare\. Rough, choppy seas, restrained hands, heavy burdens, fighting while swimming, and the like are all considered hazardous conditions, and require a character to make a Challenging \(\+0\) Athletics test as a Full Action to move\. If the character succeeds, he moves a number of metres equal to one\-half his Strength bonus \(rounded up\) in any direction\. He can also simply tread water\. If he fails, the character makes no progress and cannot move\. A character can also swim underwater, but needs to hold his breath to do so\. A character who is physically incapable of swimming \(unconscious, paralysed, bound, etc.\) automatically sinks\. While underwater, a character risks Suffocation by drowning\. 

Heavy equipment, especially armour, makes swimming incredibly difficult\. If a character is wearing armour or is otherwise weighted down \(at the GM's discretion\), all Athletics tests are made with a –30 penalty\. If a character so encumbered fails an Athletics test to swim, he suffers 1 level of Fatigue\. 

### Swimming in Narrative Time 

Prolonged swimming, no matter the circumstances, is exhausting and potentially dangerous\. A character can swim without consequence for a number of hours equal to his Toughness bonus\. After that point, he must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Toughness test at the end of each consecutive hour of swimming with a cumulative –10 penalty on each test beyond the first\. If a character fails his Toughness test, he gains a level of Fatigue\. If a swimming character falls unconscious due to Fatigue, he immediately slips beneath the surface and begins to Suffocate as per page 243\. To determine distance covered for each hour of swimming, use Table 7–24: Narrative Time Movement \(page 245\) and use the character's Strength bonus in place of his Agility bonus\. 

## Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Objects 

Under normal circumstances, it is not necessary to know exactly how much a character can carry, and common sense can serve as a guide in most instances\. In general, an average character can reasonably carry a main weapon, such as a lasgun, autogun, or flamer, plus one or two secondary weapons like a pistol or melee weapon, along with a few clips of extra ammunition and several pieces of miscellaneous equipment in a rucksack, satchel, or similar container\. It is not at all reasonable, however, for a character, even a very strong one, to be walking around with three heavy weapons and several thousand rounds of ammo for each, or for the character to have a backpack with every item from the gear section of the Armoury\. There are, however, times when just how much a character can lift or carry is crucial information\. The amount of weight a character can move is dependent on the sum of his Strength and Toughness bonuses\. Compare that total to Table Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Limits to find out the limits of a character's might\. It is important to note that certain traits and talents can increase these values\. 

### Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Limits

### Carrying Weight 

A character's Carrying Weight is how much he can comfortably carry without suffering Fatigue and penalties to his movement\. If a character carries more than this weight he is Encumbered\. 

### Lifting Weight 

A character's Lifting Weight represents the maximum amount of weight he can pick up off the ground\. A character may attempt to move while holding a heavy load, but if that load exceeds his Carrying Weight, he is Encumbered\. Lifting a heavy load is considered a Full Action\. A character can attempt to lift more than his limit by making a Challenging \(\+0\) Strength test\. For every degree of success he scores, the character adds \+1 to the sum of his Strength bonus and Toughness bonus for the purpose of determining limits\. If the character scores two or more degrees of failure, he immediately suffers one level of Fatigue\.

### Pushing Weight 

Pushing Weight is the maximum amount of weight a character can push across a smooth surface, like a ship's corridor or the polished stone floor of a dark temple\. Difficult terrain can make pushing objects difficult or even impossible\. Pushing an object is a Full Action, and pushing weight up to his limit requires no test\. Pushing weight that exceeds this limit requires a successful Challenging \(\+0\) Strength test\. For every degree of success he scores, the character adds \+1 to the sum of the character's Strength bonus and Toughness bonus for the purpose of determining limits\. If the character scores two or more degrees of failure, he immediately suffers one level of Fatigue\. 

### Encumbered Characters 

A character who attempts to carry more than his normal Carrying Weight, but less than his Lifting Weight, is considered Encumbered\. While Encumbered, the character suffers a –10 penalty to Agility tests\. Additionally, after spending a number of hours equal to his Toughness bonus while Encumbered, a character must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Toughness test or suffer one level of Fatigue\. 

### Throwing Objects 

There are many weapons, such as grenades and knives, that are designed to be thrown, but a character can attempt to throw nearly any object that weighs up to half of his normal Lifting\. To throw an object that is not a regular weapon \(i\.e\., not a grenade or knife\), a character makes a Challenging \(\+0\) Strength test\. If he succeeds, the object flies a number of metres equal to his Strength bonus\. For each additional degree of success, this distance is multiplied by the degrees of success \(one additional degree of success beyond the first doubles the distance, two additional degrees of success beyond the first triples it, and so forth\)\. If he fails, the object falls short, flying a number of metres equal to half of his Strength bonus \(rounded down\)\. If this distance is 0 metres, it falls at his feet\. If the thrown object hits a hard surface such as a wall or vehicle, the surface takes 1d10\+SB Impact damage plus 1 additional damage for each degree of success past the first\. If the object is thrown at a specific target, it is treated as an improvised weapon, and the character makes a Ballistic Skill test instead of a Strength test\. A character can attempt to throw an object that weighs more than half his Lifting Weight, but he must make a Difficult \(–10\) Strength test to hurl it successfully\. See the Armoury for more on using grenades and other Thrown weapons, plus full rules for improvised weapons\. 

## Lighting 

Players can find themselves participating in night\-time raids, under black, moonless skies, or infiltrating through dank, foetid sewer systems\. As a result, the oppressive darkness becomes an enemy in its own right, concealing countless threats and nameless terrors in its inky depths\. An experienced character knows that a reliable, portable light source like a luminen\-pack or glow\-globe is every bit as important as his weapon\. For ease of play, there are three levels of lighting conditions: Bright, Shadow, and Darkness\. Bright light is any light that allows for normal vision, such as sunlight, a well\-lit chamber, or the light of a glow\-lantern\. Shadow conditions occur during predawn and twilight hours on Terra\-like worlds, when a character is just out of range of a light source, or when a light source is obscured by an environmental effect like smoke or fog\. Darkness is, of course, the absence of light\. Aside from obscuring vision, Shadow and Darkness conditions also have a deleterious effect on a character's movement and combat capabilities\. Characters can move through Shadow at full speed with no complications\. If a character attempts to move faster than half of his Movement rate in Darkness, he must make a Hard \(–20\) Perception test to stay on course\. If he fails, he becomes disoriented and wanders in a randomly determined direction instead of moving toward his goal\. For the effects of lighting on combat, see Combat\. 

## Flying 

The following section describes the rules that cover everything blessed \(or cursed\) with the power of flight, from flying creatures and devices, to characters and NPCs with specific, flight\-capable technology\. 

### Altitude 

On a typical Terra\-like planet, there are three broad altitudes: Hovering, Low Altitude, and High Altitude\. A character who makes a Full Move action while flying can use it to move up or down one altitude level\. Moving up or down more than one altitude level in a single turn requires a Charge or Run action\. 

#### Hovering Altitude 

A hovering character or creature is skimming just above the ground, typically at an altitude of no greater than two metres, and can move over low obstacles with ease\. It can both attack and be attacked by land\-bound creatures and characters\. Often, a creature that can hover cannot fly at other altitudes, as is the case when a creature possesses the Hoverer trait\. A creature with this trait always stays at roughly the same altitude, roughly two metres above the ground, even if it descends into low terrain like a crater or valley\. Generally, hovering creatures do not willingly descend into places they cannot escape, as common sense dictates\. 

#### Low Altitude 

A character or creature flying at Low Altitude is beyond normal melee range of land\-bound threats, but still well within range of most ranged attacks from or against such characters or creatures\. A Low Altitude flier takes no penalties for attacking targets on the ground, but enemies attacking it from ground level suffer a –10 penalty to their Ballistic Skill tests \(in addition to any normal penalties for range or other factors\)\. 

#### High Altitude 

A character or creature flying at High Altitude is well beyond the reach of any attacks coming from the ground or from Low Altitude\. Characters or creatures at High Altitude can only attack or be attacked by others at the same altitude\.

### Flying Movement 

Flying characters and creatures are broken into two general categories defined by traits: Hoverers and Flyers\. Hoverers move through the air, but are limited to an altitude of roughly two metres\. A Flyer is not limited to ground level, and can ascend or descend to any altitude\. If included in a creature's profile, each trait has an associated number that dictates that creature's Flying Movement\. 

Flying Movement works just like regular Movement, but only when the creature is airborne\. While flying, a creature must make at least one Movement action \(such as Half Move, Full Move, Charge, and Run\) during each of its turns in flight to stay aloft\. If a hovering creature suddenly stops flying, due to being Stunned or not devoting a Move action, for example, it simply comes to a safe landing on the ground\. If it is at Low Altitude instead, it falls to the ground and suffers falling damage as if it fell 15 metres\. A creature that plummets from High Altitude suffers falling damage as if it fell 25 or more metres, based on the GM's discretion\.

## The Effects of Gravity 

While the Imperium's inhabited worlds might vary slightly in gravity, its effects on game play are usually minimal\. Only when characters visit high gravity or low gravity worlds, or are caught in zero gravity, are movement, lifting, and other factors affected\. 

### Low Gravity Worlds 

On worlds with low gravity, all characters have their Agility bonus increased by 2 for the purposes of Movement and Initiative\. Characters also have the sum of their Strength and Toughness bonuses increased by 4 for the purpose of determining Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Weights\. When throwing objects \(including weapons\) on low gravity worlds, characters have their Strength bonus increased by 2\. All Jumping and Leaping distances are doubled when on low gravity worlds\. 

### High Gravity Worlds 

On worlds with high gravity, all characters have their Agility bonus decreased by 2 \(to a minimum of 1\) for the purposes of Movement and Initiative\. Characters also have the sum of their Strength and Toughness bonuses decreased by 4 for the purpose of determining Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Weights\. When throwing objects on high gravity worlds, characters have their Strength bonus decreased by 2 \(to a minimum of 0\)\. All Jumping and Leaping distances are halved \(rounding up\) when on high gravity worlds\. 

### Zero Gravity 

Characters are most likely to encounter zero gravity in space, especially when there has been a significant technological failure\. Zero gravity is considered difficult terrain for determining movement, and making a Charge or Run action requires a Hard \(–20\) Agility test to avoid drifting off in a random direction\. Characters who fail the Agility test are also considered Prone\. A character starting a Move action in zero gravity must be adjacent to a floor, wall, ceiling, deck, or other secure object so that he has something to push off from\.
