# Investigation

The blessings of the Dark Gods do not simply come to those that ask for them, and not every conflict between the servants of Chaos can be resolved through death and destruction. Often a subtler approach is necessary, and any would-be Chaos Lord will need to spend time examining and learning these ways. Although Black crusade is centrally a game about the deeds and actions of Heretics as they advance along the fine path between endless infamy and total corruption, times will arise when those that serve the Chaos Gods must take a step back and search for answers hidden from lesser beings if they are to fully divine their fate. These following Investigation rules are designed to guide GMs in the creation of Investigations for their Black crusade games, adding additional depth to the endless intrigues and plots that surround all those who would Ascend.

## Using An Investigation

Many, though certainly not all, Investigations can be broken down into distinct parts:

-   The introduction to the investigation.
-   Finding and interpreting the evidence.
-   Tracking down what is required (an adversary responsible or the information the heretics are seeking).
-   Confronting the adversary or finding the information.
-   Dealing with the aftermath.

### The Introduction

The first step is to provide the Heretics with something to investigate. The Heretics' motives are also established at this time. Their motive might be the search for rivals who have been plaguing them for some time, perhaps looking for their base of operations or something very important to them that the Heretics could destroy or corrupt. The motive could be the search for more arcane knowledge, such as the True Name of a daemon, the methods required to perform a particular ritual, or the location of ancient and powerful artefacts. At other times, the Heretics may simply stumble upon, be directed to, or even forced by greater powers into a given Investigation-worthy scene or event, and the mystery can unfold from there.

Setting The Scene

Once the introduction has been established, the GM will need to flesh out the three main details of the event that required the Heretics' intervention in the first place. These are:

-   **The Adversary** This could be an individual or group who are directly attempting to destroy the Heretics, or steal or corrupt something belonging to the Heretics or their allies; or it might simply be someone who is between the Heretics and the information they seek.
-   **The Mystery** This is the event that the Heretics are investigating. Maybe the Heretics have been left stranded on Q'Sal after their transport was sabotaged by an unknown cult, or maybe a grand Tzeentchian Sorcerer has vanished, leaving his extensive artefact collection unguarded and the Heretics must learn where this hidden sanctum truly lies so that they might pillage it for its secrets.
-   **The Setting** The Investigation needs to be grounded within a specific place, such as the ash planes of Dread Korvaska or the Slave-Habs of the Hollows.

### Clues And Evidence

At the heart of any good mystery lies a clue, that piece of evidence the Heretics can use to puzzle together what is happening (or has happened) that will propel the plot forward. In some cases, the initial clue will be handed to the Heretics by an ally. Other times, the Heretics will be forced to gather the evidence for themselves, carefully sifting through the information they have gathered. Evidence can be as abstract or concrete as the GM desires. It can be a mysterious vox communiqué that may never be deciphered but is still fought over, or the remnants of a failed ritual that spurs the Heretics to discover its secrets and powers.

#### Multiple Pieces Of Evidence

The Heretics may uncover multiple pieces of evidence, and these could lead them to two or more separate destinations. This is a great way to split an Investigation and make it non-linear. The Heretics will have to choose the order on which they would like to follow the evidence, and under circumstances in which time is a factor, they may decide to split the group and send Heretics to cover multiple clues simultaneously.

### Following Leads

During this stage of the Investigation, the Heretics more fully uncover the plot. They begin to piece together the details of whatever originally necessitated the Investigation. Pacing and the appropriate establishment of dramatic tension are the most important elements of this section. Sometimes this stage of the Investigation will involve a chase, such as piloting a stolen lighter into orbit before a cell of rival cultists can escape with the location of the missing sorcerer's hidden sanctum, or catching a hated Inquisitorial agent who might have absconded with a grimoire that holds the partial True Name of a powerful Lord of Change. During this portion of the Investigation, the Heretics may also encounter all manner of complications. Their adversary may discover that he is being followed and may start covering his trail and eliminating anyone who could help the Heretics pursue him further. If the Investigation has stalled, the GM may consider providing the Heretics with a break in the case in order to get things back on track, such as a cultist barely clinging to life after a failed attempt to summon a herald of Slaanesh, or perhaps an enemy of the missing sorcerer who promises to help the Heretics find the hidden sanctum if she gets a share in the spoils. During this portion of the Investigation, the GM can also provide the Heretics with plot-specific events as a way of further explaining story elements that pertain to the Investigation at hand.

### The Showdown

Once the Heretics have uncovered or cornered their adversaries, the showdown can begin. This section usually relies on the combat rules, though a proper Investigation into the weakness of a particularly powerful foe is often crucial to its defeat. There are numerous types of adversaries to choose from and this is also an opportunity to set a memorable scene in which the environment is just as much an obstacle in the Heretics' path as their foe.

### The Resolution

This is the point when the Heretics discover how successful they were at finding the information they desire, or destroying the agents who have been working against them. It is at this stage that the immediate consequences of their actions are made known and sometimes their adversary may escape, either as a part of the plot or as a result of the actions of the Heretics. If the Heretics were successful, they can be rewarded with new resources and equipment, or perhaps even gain Infamy within the Vortex. If their Investigation was a failure, they can be punished or abandoned by those they would call allies, losing Infamy or even gaining Corruption. Here the Heretics can be rewarded for quick thinking (or penalised for the opposite). The GM can foreshadow future threats and other consequences at this point.

### Working Backwards

When building an Investigation adventure, it can be quite helpful if the GM works backwards from his intended goal. Rather than determining what the Heretics will be uncovering, and then who is behind the crime, the GM can craft a compelling villain or obstacle and decide why the Heretics would get involved. Armed with a fleshed out adversary, the GM is free to craft a more realistic storyline. The GM can determine an appropriate showdown and creative minions in the process. Working backwards from the adversary also gives the GM a better grasp of the adversary's proper motivations. An understanding of what motivates him and why he would stand in the Heretics' way can be used as a potential break in the case, or additional clues when the pacing starts to slow down. The GM can do this without an adversary, using an exciting showdown location, a creative idea for a chase, or even just a brutal crime scene as a starting point for the creation of the mystery. By working from the middle, the GM can also break the formula. Creatively dodging or baffling player expectations can provide an enjoyable evening of gaming if done correctly. This can be tricky, however, as the Heretics might feel like failure was a forgone conclusion in some Investigations, though if properly played out can be just as satisfying as a stellar victory.

## Elements Of An Investigation

An Investigation is often a smaller part of a larger adventure, but if the Investigation is the main adventure in and of itself, there are a few key details the GM should determine in advance. Investigations that represent a whole story-- beginning, middle, and end-are in need of four elements: an

introduction, an adversary for the Heretics to pursue, a clearer description of the mystery the Heretics are unravelling, and a setting in which to do their investigating.

### The Introduction

This portion of the Investigation is designed to provide the Heretics with the motivation for starting the Investigation and seeing it through. It provides a crucial hook and sets the tone for the rest of the Investigation. There are numerous other ways for a GM to begin an Investigation; perhaps one of the Heretics learns a partial ritual of Daemonhood from a sorcerer-lord he had met before, or receives a communiqué from himself warning of a future event!

### The Adversary

At this point, the GM may wish to begin to characterise the main adversary of whatever event necessitated the Investigation. This allows the GM to further plan out the theme of his Investigation and can affect the type of adversaries he plans on using. Trying to learn the True Name of a greater daemon might lead to a different kind of atmosphere than uncovering the identities of undercover Inquisitorial agents. Part of this process is figuring out what motivates the adversary. The end goal of the adversary can be as simple or as complicated as the GM likes, but it will usually factor heavily into the nature of the mission. This is especially important when setting up what the success and failure conditions are and what the Heretics need to do to achieve or avoid them. Chapter XI: Adversaries of the Black crusade Core Rulebook is a good source for sample adversaries, ranging from vengeful greater daemons to mysterious Harlequin Shadowseers.

### The Mystery

Once the GM has a good adversary, it is time to tie him to a particular plot. The Heretics need to know or possess the capacity to find out how their adversary is connected to the mystery, perhaps via a piece of evidence tied directly to the adversary's origins, or something left behind at a failed ritual. Perhaps the Heretics are helping the rulers of the Velklir track an assassin, or they may be trying to locate an escaped slave that knows the location of a hidden artefact sanctum. Sometimes an Investigation's piece of Evidence (see page 71 for further details) flows naturally from the mystery at hand, and other times establishing the clue can provide the spark that eventually leads to a fully fleshed out Investigation.

### The Setting

The Heretics now have a reason to start their Investigation, and the GM likely has an idea of what it is they may find once they get there, but the Investigation still needs a setting. The setting should have a sense of character all its own. The Screaming Vortex contains an untold number of worlds, and all are influenced by the warp and the Ruinous Powers in some way. This means that any type of terrain or combination of landscapes is possible. Even time itself is inconsistent within the warp, so a setting could encompass present, past and future events. As a final touch, the GM may wish to pre-plan how the Heretics will reach their destination or, if the GM feels so inclined, he may let the Heretics take care of the logistics themselves.

## Investigation Events

Investigation Events are a formal way of handling the Heretics' interactions with others while gathering, examining, and analysing information as part of a goal. These rules primarily offer a framework for GMs to use in preparation for an Investigation- heavy Black crusade game and secondarily offer Heretics extended options when using their investigation skills.

### In The Beginning...

Establishing where the Heretics find their first major clue is an easy way to set the theme for the rest of the Investigation. Will the Heretics be stealthily searching a heavily patrolled library of closely-guarded secrets or will they be searching a series of slave pits looking for information? Will they be scrutinising a crime scene in the depths of a hive or will they be plunging into trackless wastes in pursuit of their prey?

To find a physical clue, or to find any other details necessary to start their Investigation, the Heretics will usually have to pass an Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test, modified by both the sort of environment they are searching in and the skill of the adversary and what lengths he went to in order to hide his tracks (see Table: Search Modifiers).

#### Search Modifiers                               
  
**Environmental Factors**                             

| Roll | Scene | Modifier | Examples | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 01-25 | Pristine | +10 | Arcane Library | 
| 26-50 | Clean | +0 | Hab-Units | 
| 51-75 | Cluttered | --10 | Hive City Streets | 
| 76-00 | Total Mess | --20 | Crumbling Underhive

**Adversary's Skill**

| Roll | Scene | Modifier | Examples | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 01-25 | Careless | +10 | Crime of Passion;Khornate Ritual Massacre | 
| 26-50 | Careful | +0 | Paranoid sorcerer;professional criminal | 
| 51-75 | Expert | --10 | Trained assassin;Inquisitorial agent | 
| 76-00 | Highly Trained | --20 | Officio Assassinorum operative;Eldar Warlock | 

#### Miscellaneous Modifiers

The Awareness Test to pick through a given scene can be further modified by the Heretics' equipment, resources, and thoroughness, at the GM's discretion.

### The Evidence

At the heart of any Investigation is a crucial piece of evidence, the clue from which the Heretics must extrapolate the details of the event that they are investigating (be it something they wish to find or learn, or someone they need to stop, help or locate). The GM may pick out a piece of evidence that suits a plot that he already has in mind, or he may start with a clue and use it as his inspiration for fashioning an Investigation story. For the purposes of an Investigation, the clue is broadly used to describe anything the Heretics may come across that will propel the Investigation forward.

#### Linked Skills

A Linked Skill is a Skill that is tied to a particular piece of evidence or clue and is used to investigate that particular item. An ancient star chart would be investigated via the Scholastic Lore (Astromancy) Skill, whereas Forbidden Lore (Inquisition) might allow the Heretics to find out the identity of an Inquisitorial agent in their midst. Linked Skills serve as an easy way to come up with a theme for an Investigation. When a given piece of evidence has an appropriate Linked Skill or two, Heretics who possess those skills will have a much easier time with the Investigation. Using a Linked Skill allows the GM to gauge how difficult a given Investigation will be for a group. Linked Skills also make brainstorming plot ideas for the Investigation much easier, and the GM should always establish which Skills would be considered "linked" to each clue or piece of evidence.

### Investigation Skill Test

Each Investigation has an associated Investigation Skill Test. The Investigation Skill Test uses the Linked Skill associated with whatever clue or piece of evidence lies at the heart of the Investigation. The Difficulty of the Investigation Skill Test depends on the Investigation's Complexity. Complexity also determines the Base Time the Investigation will take to complete. The GM should choose from or roll on Table: Investigation Benchmarks to determine what the Complexity and Base Time will be for his Investigation. A success on the Investigation Skill Test allows the Heretic to roll 1d10 and add the appropriate Characteristic Bonus (as determined by the Characteristic Bonus used for the Test). This value in hours is added to the time considered successfully spent on the Investigation. For every Degree of Success after the first, he may roll another 1d10 and subtract this value in hours from the Base Time the Investigation is projected to take. This represents the Heretics skillfully making leaps of logic and drawing on past experience in order to solve the mystery. Once the Heretics have progressed the Investigation by a preset amount of time, the GM may trigger a Plot Point.

#### Investigation Benchmarks
| Roll | Complexity | Difficulty | Examples | Base Time | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| 01-10 | Simple | Easy | Discovering marketplace gossip; finding out who runs the local slave guild. | 1 hour
| 11-25 | Basic | Routine | Learning the alignment of a powerful champion; discovering the general history of an area. | 6 hours
| 26-40 | Drudging | Ordinary | Discovering the more prominent cults in an area. | 24 hours
| 41-60 | Taxing | Challenging | Identifying an obscure poison; finding the identity of underground artefact traders. | 72 hours
| 61-75 | Laborious | Difficult | Learning the history of a daemon entity; rediscovering something the Inquisition covered up. | 14 days
| 76-90 | Involved | Hard | Translating an entire tome of ancient rituals; discovering a True Name of a daemon. | 1 month
| 91-00 | Labyrinthine | Very Hard | Learning the full True Name of a powerful greater daemon; learning how to construct a daemon engine; infiltrating an enemy cult and usurping their leadership. | 1d5 years

A failure on the Investigation Test indicates that no progress has been made. Failing an Investigation Test by three or more Degrees of Failure indicates that the Investigation has suffered a serious setback. The GM should add 1d10 hours to the Base Time required to complete the Investigation and may trigger a Complication (see below). Failing by five or more Degrees indicates that the Investigation has ground to a complete halt. The GM may either declare the Investigation a failure, or trigger a Break in the Case (see below) to allow the Heretics to get the Investigation back on track. The GM may alternatively decide to trigger a Complication, Break in the Case, or Plot Point at any time he deems it narratively appropriate to do so and, for Investigations of Arduous or greater Complexity, the GM can reduce or increase the Total Time or Base Time (based on the results of an Investigation Skill Test) by percentage increments instead of hours.

#### Assisting an Investigation

An Investigation Skill Test can benefit from Assistance. Each assisting ally reduces the difficulty of the Investigation Skill Test by one step. Each assisting ally must have a Linked Skill appropriate to the piece of information being investigated and no more than two allies can assist on a single Test. Assistance does not affect the Base Time of an Investigation Skill Test. Sometimes Heretics will have ideas about how to further an Investigation that are beyond the scope of a Skill Test. If a Heretic takes a particular action that the GM deems helpful to the Investigation, even if it is not particularly Skill-related, the GM can reduce the difficulty of the Investigation Skill Test or, in the case of a successful Investigation Skill Test, award the Investigation a number of Degrees of Successes based on how helpful the Heretic's actions were. If a Heretic has taken an action that the GM decides will ultimately be harmful to the Investigation, the GM can increase the difficulty of the Investigation Skill Test, or penalise a failed Investigation Skill Test with extra Degrees of Failure.

#### The Next Step

Once the time spent equals the Investigation's Base Time, the Investigation is a success. The Heretics receive the information they are looking for and may continue on to whatever the GM has planned for them.

### Complications, Breaks, And Plot Points

Each Investigation has additional events that can be triggered at various points. Complications occur when the Heretics accrue too many Degrees of Failure or hit specific triggers. Breaks in the Case occur when the Investigation completely stalls out and the GM wants to give the Heretics a second chance instead of declaring the Investigation a failure. Plot Points occur as a way for the GM to further the narrative and add additional flavour to the adventure.

#### Complications

Complications are challenges that occur during the Investigation. A Complication usually manifests as an in-game problem that needs to be either role played or fought through. Complications can include false leads throwing the Heretics off the right path, vital evidence being stolen, their disguises revealed, enemy factions attempting to stop the Investigation by force, or agents of a higher authority getting in the way. The possibilities are endless and the GM should always try to come up with a unique complication for the Heretics to face. The GM should provide a bonus to the next Investigation Skill Test the Heretics take if they resolve the Complication successfully.

#### Breaks in the Case

Failing the Investigation Test by five or more Degrees of Failure means that the Investigation has ground to a halt. The GM can allow the Heretics to fail the Investigation, or he can use a Break in the Case to get the Investigation moving again. This could come in the form of an anonymous tip pointing the Heretics back in the right direction, or perhaps a rival of their adversary offering some extra advice, or even another event taking place similar to the event that started the entire Investigation in the first place (such as the same failed ritual being attempted again). Each Break in the Case represents an opportunity that the Heretics can use to find new and different avenues for their Investigation. It may involve bringing to light information about the evidence they have already gathered or it may involve new evidence altogether.

#### Plot Points

Plot Points are challenges that the Heretics must overcome that tie into the main story or that reveal a critical part of the plot. Plot Points can be generic, but they are often tied to a given piece of evidence's Linked Skill. Plot Points can range from basic combat where the Heretics need to fight their way out of trouble, to a new discovery that reveals something more about their adversary, to a twist that throws them in a new direction or changes the way they viewed a previous piece of evidence, or even more details about the overall narrative within the Investigation. As with Complications and Breaks in the Case, the GM is encouraged to come up with new and interesting Plot Points to further the Investigation.

Plot Points are storytelling elements first and foremost, so it is entirely appropriate to mix and match them. Because a given piece of evidence's Linked Skill is so often tied thematically to the plot of the ongoing Investigation, it is often a good idea to incorporate the theme of that Skill into the Investigation as one of the Plot Points (such as machinery and technology if the Linked Skill was based around Tech- Use, or warp travel and voidship technology if the Linked Skill was based around the Navigate (Warp) Skill).

#### The Ticking Clock\...

The GM can add tension by keeping strict track of time. Adding plot point events that are set to happen on a regular schedule and/or using a deadline to measure an Investigation's success or failure are both valid ways to keep an Investigation interesting.

## Ending The Investigation

The final step is resolving the Investigation. The GM should look at how successful or unsuccessful the Heretics were in seeing the Investigation to its close and reward or penalise them as appropriate.

### Success

First and foremost, the most important result of a successful Investigation is that the Heretics get whatever piece of information they seek. Sometimes this will be the data that leads them directly to the next part of the adventure. Other times it will be important information to be used later. More rewards for the Heretics succeeding include equipment, experience, Infamy, contacts, and, where appropriate, Corruption. Generally speaking, a successful Investigation should see the Heretics rise above where they once were-- there is no altruism within the Vortex, so any Investigation will likely be conducted out of selfishness or self-preservation. GMs should reward ruthless Heretics who successfully complete Investigations, especially if they emerge from the Investigation more powerful than when they first started.

### Failure

The GM should also have a few failure conditions written into the Investigation. This can be as simple as a certain cumulative amount of Degrees of Failure on the Investigation Skill Test, whether or not a certain Plot Point is botched by the Heretics, or even a hard time limit. Penalties for the Heretics failing can include the loss of an important NPC, demotion and a loss of Infamy, Corruption, the ire of a powerful daemon, the loss of Dark Patronage from the Dark Gods, or a host of other negative consequences. The Screaming Vortex is an unforgiving place, so GMs are encouraged to be quite unforgiving themselves.
