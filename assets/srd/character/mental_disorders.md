The range and scale of unpleasant disorders that might afflict a character is potentially limitless, and a few examples are presented here\. GMs should also feel free to invent their own to suit individual characters and the terrible trials they’ve undergone\. Below are a few examples of common battlefield disorders, any of which may progress during a character’s development from Minor to Acute:

## Phobia

The character has a deep fear of a particular thing or circumstance\. A phobic character must succeed on a Willpower test to interact with the sources of his phobia\. Enforced or gratuitous exposure to the source of his disorder may incur Fear tests\. Examples of this disorder include:

### Fear of the Dead 

The character has an abiding fear and loathing of corpses and the dead, and can’t stand to be around them for any length of time\. Perhaps this is because sometimes they refuse to stay dead, or have others inhabit their flesh\.\.\.

### Fear of Insects

Scuttling, carapaced things with many legs are the stuff of this character’s waking nightmares: faceless, numberless, and hungry, forever hungry\.

## Obsession/Compulsion

The character has a compulsion to perform a particular action or is obsessed with a particular thing\. A character must make a Willpower test not to act in a compulsive way or pursue his obsession when the opportunity arises\. Examples of this disorder:

### Kleptomania 

A character compulsively steals small objects if he has the opportunity\. Often the character attaches no value to the items, he just feels the need to steal them\.

### Self\-Mortification

The character feels the need to scourge and whip his flesh on a regular basis in order to purge away the sin of his actions through pain\. This may be tied to a particular event, such as killing or thinking impure thoughts\.

### The Flesh is Weak

The character blames the limitations of his own body for his failures and problems\. He becomes increasingly obsessed with surgical modification and bionic replacement\.

## Visions and Voices

The character sees things that are not there and hears things that others do not\. Acute sufferers may experience visions into which they are totally immersed\.

### Dead Acolyte

The character hears the voice of an old ally now long\-dead, perhaps a fellow Acolyte that he was unable to save or who sacrificed his life for the character\. At a Severe level he may even have visions of his friend, or converse with him if his condition becomes Acute\.

### Flashbacks

The character relives traumatic moments from his life, often harkening back to a particularly vicious or harrowing battle with foul cultists\. The length and vividness of these episodes varies according to the seriousness of his condition\.

## Delusion

The character suffers from a particular false belief that he must act on as if it were the truth, despite his better judgement or any evidence to the contrary\.

### Invulnerability

The character believes that he will never get severely injured, possibly through luck or divine providence\. Such a character would have to pass a Willpower test to avoid taking on a vastly superior force instead of exercising due caution\.

### Righteousness

The character believes that his choices are right and justified, no matter the cost\. Such a character may callously and needlessly send allies to their deaths in the pursuit of a failing attack plan, even when the evidence that a change in tactics is necessary becomes overwhelming\.

## Horrific Nightmares

The character suffers from vivid and recurring nightmares, like imagining the outcome of a failed Gellar Field, or being vivisected by masked men while paralysed and helpless\. After any stressful day, he must pass a Willpower test in order to not succumb to his terrors while asleep\. If he fails, he suffers 1 level of Fatigue on the following day\.
