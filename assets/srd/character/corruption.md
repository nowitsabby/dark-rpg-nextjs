# Corruption

The corrupting taint of Chaos is ever\-present in the galaxy, and even Acolytes are not immune to its insidious touch\. Encounters with Daemons, dark rituals, and even the knowledge that such things are possible are all paths to corruption\. The swirling tempest of psychoactive energies and pseudo\-matter that makes up the fabric of Warp\-space is more deadly than any radiation\. It can instantly destroy, but it can also effect hideous transformations on material, body, and mind, far beyond anything found in a sane universe\. To most, corruption is a doom to be avoided at all costs, but some, once they find themselves walking the path to damnation, will seek to embrace the darkness\.

## Corruption Points

Corruption points \(CP\) operate much like Insanity points, except they are gained through exposure to the Warp, dark rituals, cursed artefacts, and daemonic influence\. A PC begins the game with 0 Corruption Points and gains more over time as damage is done to the purity of her soul. The more Corruption points a character has, the more afflicted she becomes; this is reflected in the rules by the risk of Malignancies and Mutation\. Should CP ever reach 100, the character is either executed by the Inquisition for their moral failing, so horribly mutated that they can no longer function, or flees from light of the Emperor and becomes a servant of Chaos\. In any case they must be retired from play\.

### The Corruption Track
__CP Total__|__Degree Of Corruption__|__Malignancy Test__|__Mutation__   
--------|--------------------|---------------|-----------
01–30   |Tainted             |0              |—          
31–60   |Soiled              |–10            |First Test 
61–90   |Debased             |–20            |Second Test
91–99   |Profane             |–30            |Third Test 
100+    |Damned              |               |           

## Moral Threats

The exact level of Corruption points inflicted by a particular event, revelation, or encounter is determined by the GM\. The following examples can act as guidelines:

#### Warp Shock

If the character suffers Insanity points resulting from a failed Fear test involving a Warp entity, she suffers a number of Corruption points equal to the being's Fear rating\. Fear \(2\), for example, would mean the Acolyte gains 2 CP\.

#### Rending the Veil

Characters caught in a full\-blown intrusion of the Warp into corporeal reality gain Corruption points from the experience\. The severity of the Warp breach affects how many Corruption points Acolytes exposed to it suffer \(1d5 for a minor Warp intrusion, or 1d10 or more for a larger tear in reality\)\.

#### Sorcery

Practicing sorcery, witnessing dread rituals, or invoking even the least of Daemons are all causes of Corruption\. Minor sorcerous rituals inflict 1d5 Corruption points, while larger rituals inflict 1d10 or more\.

#### Blasphemous Lore

Knowledge itself can corrupt\. The study of certain foul tomes, malignant texts, or ancient pict\-logs can cause an Acolyte to gain Corruption points even if she does not comprehend the unholy words or images\.

#### Dark Deeds

Evil acts done in the furtherance of a malignancy, in pursuit of forbidden lore, or to appease a Daemon always cause the perpetrator to gain 1d5 or 1d10 Corruption points, depending on the actions or Daemon involved\.

#### Profane Relics

Chaos devices and amulets are steeped with terrible energies\. Merely handling a rune\-encrusted weapon or wearing gore\-soaked armour that a servant of the Ruinous Powers once used can corrupt\. Minor instances should inflict 1d5 Corruption points, while prolonged use can inflict 1d10 or more\.

#### Vile Persuasion

Many Daemons and cult leaders are masters of insidious temptation and of sowing the seeds of doubt in a faithful heart\. Their words and arguments can corrupt where force alone would fail\. Holding an extended conversation with such a being, or losing Opposed Social tests against her, can inflict 1d5 or more Corruption points on a character, at the GM's discretion\.

## Roleplaying Corruption

Gaining Corruption should always be a significant event for an Acolyte\. While Insanity represents her mind failing to withstand the horrors of life in the 41st Millennium, Corruption represents her soul slowly falling to Chaos—the very force she strives to combat—piece by piece\. For one who knows the hidden, terrible truths of what Chaos represents, there can be no more hideous a fate than to feel her soul's destruction and the terrible future that awaits her\. As such, this should be an important part of how the player conducts her character\.

Mutations and malignancies are manifestations of Corruption; even when they are not visible or even present, though, the character is always suffering, as her soul is being rent apart in spiritual torment\. A player should not wait for actual mutations or malignancies to occur before looking for ways to represent even slight accumulations of Corruption\. It might start with subtle fears towards situations or objects similar to what caused her to gain the Corruption, or increasing self\-loathing for lacking the moral strength to resist Chaos\. Her character could become increasingly defeatist, paranoid, and suspicious, or might even unconsciously seek out other opportunities to gain further Corruption as her soul slowly slides into blackness\. Working with the GM, the player can use these to develop her character's personality and fate in ways to best reflect the terrors of this nightmare future\.

## Removing Corruption

The insidious touch of the Ruinous Powers represents a permanent taint on the soul, and is normally impossible to remove\. It is this permanence that makes Chaos so difficult to combat, for once it is within someone, it grows and festers like a tainted wound\. It is possible though, in very rare situations, for the effects of corruption to be lessened\. This is always an extraordinary occurrence, and might happen once in a campaign at most\. It could represent a visitation from a Living Saint after her shrine was successfully purged of foul cultists eager to perform a ritual desecration, the blessing from an Arch\-Cardinal for the respectful recovery of a holy relic used millennia ago to banish a Greater Daemon, or some similarly powerful and singular event\. This can only reduce Corruption by a small measure, usually no more than 1 or 2 points, though the GM can modify this depending on the nature of the event\.
