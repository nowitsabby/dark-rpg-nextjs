# Corruption

The corrupting taint of Chaos is ever\-present in the galaxy, and even Acolytes are not immune to its insidious touch\. Encounters with Daemons, dark rituals, and even the knowledge that such things are possible are all paths to corruption\. The swirling tempest of psychoactive energies and pseudo\-matter that makes up the fabric of Warp\-space is more deadly than any radiation\. It can instantly destroy, but it can also effect hideous transformations on material, body, and mind, far beyond anything found in a sane universe\. To most, corruption is a doom to be avoided at all costs, but some, once they find themselves walking the path to damnation, will seek to embrace the darkness\.

## Corruption Points

Corruption points \(CP\) operate much like Insanity points, except they are gained through exposure to the Warp, dark rituals, cursed artefacts, and daemonic influence\. A PC begins the game with 0 Corruption Points and gains more over time as damage is done to the purity of his soul. The more Corruption points a character has, the more afflicted he becomes; this is reflected in the rules by the risk of Malignancies and Mutation\. Should CP ever reach 100, the character is either executed by the Inquisition for their moral failing, so horribly mutated that they can no longer function, or flees from light of the Emperor and becomes a servant of Chaos\. In any case they must be retired from play\.

### The Corruption Track
__CP Total__|__Degree Of Corruption__|__Malignancy Test__|__Mutation__   
--------|--------------------|---------------|-----------
01–30   |Tainted             |0              |—          
31–60   |Soiled              |–10            |First Test 
61–90   |Debased             |–20            |Second Test
91–99   |Profane             |–30            |Third Test 
100+    |Damned              |               |           

## Moral Threats

The exact level of Corruption points inflicted by a particular event, revelation, or encounter is determined by the GM\. The following examples can act as guidelines:

#### Warp Shock

If the character suffers Insanity points resulting from a failed Fear test involving a Warp entity, he suffers a number of Corruption points equal to the being’s Fear rating\. Fear \(2\), for example, would mean the Acolyte gains 2 CP\.

#### Rending the Veil

Characters caught in a full\-blown intrusion of the Warp into corporeal reality gain Corruption points from the experience\. The severity of the Warp breach affects how many Corruption points Acolytes exposed to it suffer \(1d5 for a minor Warp intrusion, or 1d10 or more for a larger tear in reality\)\.

#### Sorcery

Practicing sorcery, witnessing dread rituals, or invoking even the least of Daemons are all causes of Corruption\. Minor sorcerous rituals inflict 1d5 Corruption points, while larger rituals inflict 1d10 or more\.

#### Blasphemous Lore

Knowledge itself can corrupt\. The study of certain foul tomes, malignant texts, or ancient pict\-logs can cause an Acolyte to gain Corruption points even if he does not comprehend the unholy words or images\.

#### Dark Deeds

Evil acts done in the furtherance of a malignancy, in pursuit of forbidden lore, or to appease a Daemon always cause the perpetrator to gain 1d5 or 1d10 Corruption points, depending on the actions or Daemon involved\.

#### Profane Relics

Chaos devices and amulets are steeped with terrible energies\. Merely handling a rune\-encrusted weapon or wearing gore\-soaked armour that a servant of the Ruinous Powers once used can corrupt\. Minor instances should inflict 1d5 Corruption points, while prolonged use can inflict 1d10 or more\.

#### Vile Persuasion

Many Daemons and cult leaders are masters of insidious temptation and of sowing the seeds of doubt in a faithful heart\. Their words and arguments can corrupt where force alone would fail\. Holding an extended conversation with such a being, or losing Opposed Social tests against him, can inflict 1d5 or more Corruption points on a character, at the GM’s discretion\.

## The Malignancy Test

For every 10 total Corruption points a character gains, he must make a Willpower test to see if his Corruption has manifested as literal damage to his body and soul\. This roll is modified depending on the number of CP the character already possesses as noted on The Corruption Track\. If the character fails the test, his spiritual Corruption is given form\. These metaphysical and psychosomatic scars are called Malignancies, and are randomly rolled on Table Malignancies\. If a player rolls a result that he has previously suffered for failing a previous Malignancy test, he must roll again until he receives a new result\.

### Malignancies
D100 | Malignancy |Effect
------------------------|------------------------
01–10 | Palsy |The character suffers from numerous minor tics, shakes, and tremors with no medical cause. Reduce his Agility by 1d10.
11–15 | Dark-hearted      |The character grows increasingly cruel, callous, and vindictive. Reduce his Fellowship by 1d10.
16–20 | Ill-fortuned      |Chance seems to mock this Acolyte at the most crucial of opportunities. Whenever this character uses a Fate point, roll 1d10. On a result of 7–10, the Fate point has no effect but is spent anyway.
21–25 | Skin Afflictions  |The character is plagued by boils, scabs, weeping sores and other disgusting features across his body. He suffers a –20 penalty to all Charm tests.
26–30 | Night Eyes        |Light pains the character, echoing the growing stain on his soul. Unless he shields his eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty on all tests made in an area of bright light.
31–33 | Morbid            |The character finds it hard to concentrate as his mind turns increasingly macabre and he becomes prone to tortured, gloom filled trains of thought. Reduce his Intelligence by 1d10.
34–45 | Witch-Mark        |The character develops some minor physical deformity or easily concealable mutation. It is small, but perhaps enough to consign him to death if found out by a fanatical witch hunter.
46–50 | Fell Obsession    |This functions like the Obsession Disorder, but in this case the character is obsessed by something sinister or malign (such as collecting finger-bone trophies, ritual scarification, carrying out meaningless vivisections, etc.).
51–55 | Irrational Nausea |The character feels sick at the sight, sound, or smell of something otherwise innocuous (such as prayer books and holy items, bare flesh, human laughter, fresh food, etc.). When he encounters an object of his revulsion he must make a Toughness test or suffer a –10 penalty to all tests as long as he remains in its presence.
56–60 | Wasted Frame      |The character’s pallor becomes corpse-like and his muscles waste away. Reduce his Strength by 1d10.
61–63 | Night Terrors     |The character is plagued by daemonic visions in his sleep. This functions identically to the Horrific Nightmares Disorder.
64–70 | Poor Health       |The character constantly suffers petty illnesses and phantom pains, and his wounds never seem to fully heal. Reduce the character’s Toughness by 1d10.
71–75 | Distrustful       |The character cannot conceal the distrust and antipathy he has for others. He suffers a –10 penalty to Fellowship tests when dealing with strangers.
76–80 | Malign Sight      |The world seems to darken, tarnish, and rot if the character looks at anything too long. Reduce the character’s Perception by 1d10.
81–83 | Ashen Taste       |Food and drink taste foul and provide little sustenance to the character, and he can barely stomach eating. Recovering levels of Fatigue takes twice as long for him than normal.
84–90 | Bloodlust         |Murderous rage is never far from the character’s mind. After suffering damage (after Armour and Toughness bonus) in combat, he must succeed at a Willpower test to allow his enemies to flee, be captured, or incapacitated, rather than killing them outright, even if his intent is otherwise.
91–93 | Blackouts         |The character suffers from inexplicable blackouts. When they occur and what happens during them is up to the Game Master, who should inform the player the details of what (if anything) he remembers on awakening.
94–100 | Strange Addiction |The character has a near-uncontrollable craving for some bizarre and unnatural substance (such as rose petals, fresh blood, widows’ tears, etc.). This acts like a Minor Disorder for Compulsion, but is freakish enough to cause serious suspicion if discovered.

## Mutation

A character’s Corruption points total is also used to determine the terrible effects of Chaos upon his body\. As his Corruption builds, his flesh may revolt, twisted by the Dark Gods\. Of course, such is the insidious nature of Chaos that it is constantly hunting for weakness in mind and body, testing a character’s defences until it can find a way into his soul\. For every 30 Corruption points a character gains, he must make a test against two Characteristics of his choice\. *He can never test against the same characteristics twice to resist mutation, and should make a note on his Character Sheet of which characteristics he has already used to resist mutation\.*

Failure on either test means he suffers a mutation\. The unfortunate Acolyte rolls a 1d100 to gain a random mutation from Table Mutations\. Should this give him a mutation he already possesses, he must roll again until it results in a fresh mutation\.

Note that the GM can alternatively select specific mutations and malignancies, to represent unique daemonic energies or the influences of Warp\-tainted artefacts\. He can also choose to simply apply specific traits as a mutation result, especially Amphibious, Blind, Burrower, Darksight, Fear, Multiple Arms, Natural Armour, Natural Weapons, Quadruped, Regeneration, Size \(increase or decrease by one\), Sonar Sense, or Toxic\.

### Mutations
__D100__                 |__Effect__
--------------------------|--------------------------
01–06 Bestial Hide        |The character’s skin becomes toughened with layers of thick scales or chitin, and he gains the Natural Armour (2) trait.
07–11 Unnatural Arms      |Twisted appendages (shriveled arms, hooked talons, or fleshy tendrils) emerge from this character’s spine or torso. He gains the Multiple Arms (CB) trait.
12–17 Sightless Orbs      |This character’s eyes become sightless, cracked windows into a soul afflicted with a growing corruption. He gains the Blind and Unnatural Senses (CBx10) traits.
18–25 Swollen Brute       |This character becomes bloated, his muscles expanding and his form becoming excessively corpulent or disturbingly muscular (or perhaps both). This character’s Toughness and Strength characteristics are permanently increased by 10, but his Agility bonus is reduced by 1 for purposes of movement.
26–30 Deathsight          |This character’s mind becomes twisted, his eyes showing him countless possible annihilations of anything or anyone he gazes upon for more than a few moments. Once per game session, this character may increase the damage of one attack he has made by his Corruption bonus. If he does so, he gains 1 Corruption point.
31–36 Cursed Fleshmetal   |This character’s armour and cybernetic implants become fused with his flesh, and even regenerate. Removing any of these items requires a Challenging (+0) Medicae test; if the test fails, he suffers 1d5 Rending damage to a randomly selected limb that ignores Armour. He can make an Ordinary (+10) Toughness test to repair items merged with him, in the same manner as a Tech-Use test to repair the same equipment, but suffers 1 Corruption point.
37–43 Razor Fangs         |This character’s teeth grow long, turning into tearing fangs. This character gains an unarmed attack that inflicts 1d5+CB Rending damage, pen 2. He permanently reduces his Fellowship characteristic by 1d5.
44–49 Excessive Legs      |This character develops extra legs that support his form, suspending his upper torso above a centauroid lower body. This character gains the Quadruped trait with a number of extra legs equal half to his Corruption bonus (rounded up).
50–54 Wings               |Massive feathered or leathery wings erupt from this character’s spine, and he gains the Flyer (CB x 2) trait.
55–60 Serpentine Tail     |This character’s legs wither while his spine elongates into a serpentine tail that supports his body. He gains the Crawler trait and gains an unarmed attack that can strike for 1d10 Impact damage, Pen 0.
61–69 Searing Blood       |This character’s veins are filled with searing acids in place of blood, though somehow the corrosive effects do not burn his own flesh. Whenever he suffers Blood Loss, the foul liquid erupts and inflicts 1d5+CB Energy damage, Pen 0, to each other character within 1d5 metres.
70–77 Witch-Curse         |A small stigma in the shape of a maddening rune appears on this character’s body, marking him as touched by Chaos. He gains the Psyker trait (or adds 1 to an existing psy rating) and freely learns any 1 psychic power that costs 100 xp or less. Whenever he attempts to use this power, he gains 1d5 Corruption points.
78–84 Bone-Blades         |This character’s bones grow long, twisted spurs that sprout painfully from his flesh on his command. This character gains an unarmed attack that inflicts 1d10+CB Rending damage, Pen 0. Whenever he makes an attack with this weapon, this character suffers Blood Loss unless he passes a Challenging (+0) Toughness test.
85–89 Cannibalistic Urge  |Blood and marrow become as wine and bread to this character, and normal food no longer sates the hunger of his soul. Once per game session, he can remove 1d5 damage by consuming human flesh. Each time he does so, he gains 1 Corruption point.
90–92 Corrupted Flesh     |Instead of blood, when this character’s flesh is torn asunder, horrific insects, worms, or flitting creatures spill forth. Whenever he suffers damage, this character gains the Fear (1) trait for 1d5 rounds.
93–94 It Will Not Die!    |This character is touched by the power of the Warp, and fortune twists to keep him alive regardless of the terrible wounds he suffers, as if it is the will of some dark being that resides beyond the veil of reality. He can no longer burn a Fate point to survive lethal injuries. Whenever this character would die, he instead survives by the narrowest margin as if he had burned a Fate point and gains 1d10+5 Corruption points.
95–97 Warp Gaze           |Whatever this character looks upon burns with the fire of the Warp, and all who see his eyes despair. This character gains a 20m ranged attack that strikes with 1d10+CB Energy damage and the Spray quality. Each time he uses this attack, he gains 1d5 Corruption points. Characters struck with this attack must make a Challenging (+0) Fear (1) test.
98–99 Warp Regeneration   |Corruption seethes through this character’s flesh, sewing his body back together time and time again whether he wills it or not. Whenever this character suffers damage, he makes a Challenging (+0) Toughness test. If he succeeds, he gains the Regeneration (CB) trait for 1 round and gains 1d5 Corruption points.
100 The Warp Made Manifest|This character becomes a Daemon-like creature, capable of reshaping reality itself at his whim. He gains the Daemonic (CB), Fear (2), From Beyond, and Warp Instability traits. He can also use his Willpower characteristic in place of any other characteristic for any test he is called upon to take.

## Roleplaying Corruption

Gaining Corruption should always be a significant event for an Acolyte\. While Insanity represents his mind failing to withstand the horrors of life in the 41st Millennium, Corruption represents his soul slowly falling to Chaos—the very force he strives to combat—piece by piece\. For one who knows the hidden, terrible truths of what Chaos represents, there can be no more hideous a fate than to feel his soul’s destruction and the terrible future that awaits him\. As such, this should be an important part of how the player conducts his character\.

Mutations and malignancies are manifestations of Corruption; even when they are not visible or even present, though, the character is always suffering, as his soul is being rent apart in spiritual torment\. A player should not wait for actual mutations or malignancies to occur before looking for ways to represent even slight accumulations of Corruption\. It might start with subtle fears towards situations or objects similar to what caused him to gain the Corruption, or increasing self\-loathing for lacking the moral strength to resist Chaos\. His character could become increasingly defeatist, paranoid, and suspicious, or might even unconsciously seek out other opportunities to gain further Corruption as his soul slowly slides into blackness\. Working with the GM, the player can use these to develop his character’s personality and fate in ways to best reflect the terrors of this nightmare future\.

## Removing Corruption

The insidious touch of the Ruinous Powers represents a permanent taint on the soul, and is normally impossible to remove\. It is this permanence that makes Chaos so difficult to combat, for once it is within someone, it grows and festers like a tainted wound\. It is possible though, in very rare situations, for the effects of corruption to be lessened\. This is always an extraordinary occurrence, and might happen once in a campaign at most\. It could represent a visitation from a Living Saint after her shrine was successfully purged of foul cultists eager to perform a ritual desecration, the blessing from an Arch\-Cardinal for the respectful recovery of a holy relic used millennia ago to banish a Greater Daemon, or some similarly powerful and singular event\. This can only reduce Corruption by a small measure, usually no more than 1 or 2 points, though the GM can modify this depending on the nature of the event\.
