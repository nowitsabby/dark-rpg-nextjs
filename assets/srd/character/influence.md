# Influence

Influence is a characteristic, and like other characteristics it is measured on a scale from 0–100\. Influence represents a Character’s reputation, connections, resources, and other factors that allow him to obtain desired results from the citizens and institutions of the Imperium\. The higher a character’s Influence, the better he is able to exert control over others, and hence the easier it is for him to get items delivered, services performed, and other actions taken at his request\. All Characters start with a certain amount of Influence, which they can increase through gameplay\.

## Uses Of Influence

Whenever a Character attempts to use his reputation or resources within the Imperium, the GM can call for an Influence test\. As with other characteristics, there are numerous ways in which a character may utilise his Influence, but some common uses include the following:

- __Requisition:__ When a Character attempts to obtain equipment, supplies, or services, it is his Influence that determines if he has the resources, connections, or funds to track down and acquire or purchase the item\. This use of Influence represents a Character calling on his contacts, bribing or pressuring merchants, relying on his reputation with the relevant Imperial organisation, or even retrieving the necessary funds from a financier\. 
- __Social Interaction:__ Dropping the right names or invoking a fearsome reputation can go far in convincing others to reveal information or acquiesce to a character’s wishes\. Indeed, merely invoking the name of the Inquisition is enough to have many loyal citizens falling over backwards to obey\. A Character can use his Influence to manipulate others into doing his bidding, revealing information, or otherwise offering assistance\. He can also use this to generate local currencies as needed for bribes or other social actions where monetary lubrication would be beneficial\. In certain cases, such as when interacting with an individual or organization with comparable or greater Influence, the GM may require this to be an opposed Influence test\. All this can attract attention if done too overtly, though this can be desirable when the warband desires their presence known in order to flush out their prey, for example\.
- __Investigation:__ In the course of an investigation, Characters often need to access resources and information beyond their personal abilities and assets\. Characters can use their Influence to cast a wider net and expedite the investigation\. This can include leaning on contacts for information, gaining access to restricted archives, or ensuring cooperation by local authorities\. Leveraging Influence can greatly smoothen the investigation, though using it too often can attract attention\.

## Gaining Influence

Unlike other characteristics, players cannot increase their Character’s Influence by spending xp on advances\. Influence can only be increased though a Character’s actions\. A Character’s Influence increases as the character succeeds at his duty, or as a result of specific actions the Character takes to increase his reputation and resources\. The following are some of the most common reasons for a Character’s Influence to increase:

- __Connections:__ Knowing the right people can be instrumental in getting things done\. Taking one’s request straight to the best person to act on it, cutting through the layers of bureaucracy and avoiding communication delays, can achieve faster and more effective results\. Whether looking at a single hive city or a sub\-sector, the Characters discover again and again that ties of fealty, responsibility, and authority construct a tangled web and an almost crippling inertia\. For a Character to be able to contact the right individual directly can mean the difference between a world’s salvation and its damnation\. Connections can come from earlier shared experiences, such as common service in the Imperial Guard or aboard the same voidship, or can occur during investigations as a Character meets new people and establishes relationships\. Organisations for which a Character has the Peer talent indicate strong connections as well\. It is up to the GM to determine how much Influence a connection is worth\. Forming a close bond with a merchant group operating on a single planet may potentially be worth a point or so of Influence, while simply having one’s name known to the Lord Sector may be worth several\.
- __Debts and Favours:__ Perhaps the most effective way to gain assistance from an individual is by calling in a favour or settling a debt\. Doing so provides an immediate incentive for the person or organisation to act in accordance with the Character’s wishes\. This is particularly true when it is undesirable or unthinkable to explain the reasons behind the request, a situation in which Characters often find themselves\. By accomplishing tasks for an individual or organisation, or otherwise benefitting it through their actions, a Character’s Influence can increase\. The amount of the increase depends on the power and Influence of the person or organisation, as well as the importance of the task or benefit\.
- __Reputation:__ Characters often achieve their wishes by relying on their reputation\. By accomplishing his duties and performing impressive feats, a Character can increase his Influence as his name becomes known to the great and powerful, as well as the toiling masses of Imperial governance\. Uncovering and foiling a plot by Chaos cultists, saving a powerful noble from certain doom, or even sentencing a world to Exterminatus are all actions that can raise a Character’s Influence\. The degree of increase depends both on the importance of the action, and on how overt or subtle the Character is in this performance\. Executing a heretic in a great spectacle can spread a Character’s name across a world and beyond, but saving a planet from certain destruction might do little for a character’s wider reputation beyond those few privy to the act\.

### Influence Increases

1|Bringing a minor heretek to justice and stopping his production of unsanctified weapons; disrupting a lesser Faceless Trade operation in minor heretical artefacts\.
2|Uncovering and purging a coven of xenophilious nobles; gaining the esteem of a High Marshal of the Adeptus Arbites\.
3|Saving the life of a Lord Admiral; detecting and alerting a significant Imperial world of a forthcoming xenos attack\.
4|Impressing an important sector lord at a formal banquet; successfully investigating and denouncing a radical Inquisitor\.
5|Saving a sub\-sector capital world from certain destruction; banishing a Greater Daemon back to the Warp\.

## Losing Influence

Just as certain actions and results can increase a Character’s Influence, so can his decisions and even simple chance result in decreases to his Influence\. Reputation is fickle, and Characters must take care to protect theirs\. At the GM’s discretion, a Character’s Influence can decrease when something happens to weaken his resource network and reputation, whether through his own fault or due to outside agency\. The following are just some examples of events that might decrease a Character’s Influence:

- __Failure:__ Just as success increases Influence, so does failure decrease it\. Failing to stop the Imperium’s enemies harms the Characters’ reputation in the eyes of the Imperium’s rulers and leaders, and may also decrease the confidence their Inquisitor has in their abilities\. In the most extreme cases, failing to stop a heretical plot may even lead some to suspect the Characters of treachery\. Similarly, when performing a task for an individual or organisation that would result in an increase in the Character’s Influence, failure can have the opposite effect, particularly in the case of very egregious failure that harms the interests of the would\-be benefactor\. The amount by which failure decreases a Character’s Influence depends on the severity of the failure, and how subtle or overt the Character’s actions\.
- __Excessive or Reckless Use:__ Influence reflects a Character’s standing in the Imperium and reputation in the eyes of his peers and betters\. Abuse or misuse of his authority can swiftly turn opinion against him\. When a Character fails an Influence test by more degrees of failure than his Fellowship bonus, his Influence decreases by the difference between the two\.
- __Sacrifice:__ In desperate situations, a Character may be forced to sacrifice his resources or reputation to accomplish a goal\. This could mean calling in a major favour, requesting an onerous task of, and thereby alienating, an ally, or even sending allies or servants on a suicide mission\. When attempting an Influence test, before rolling, a Character may choose to decrease his Influence by 1d5 in order to automatically succeed\. If degrees of success are important, the Character is considered to have achieved a number equal to his Fellowship bonus\. Note that in situations where no test is possible, this use of Influence cannot be made: the situation is beyond even the Character’s ability, or the item is impossible to acquire\.
- __Atrophy:__ A Character must continuously attend to his Influence, lest it slip away with the passage of time\. If a Character goes long enough without any new achievements to bolster his reputation, he risks his name being forgotten by contacts, his achievements overshadowed by others, and his reputation tarnishing as those who remember his name reflect on his absence from the stage\. For each year that passes during which the Character does not perform any work for his Inquisitor, his Influence decreases by 1\.
- __Reinforcement Aid:__ Influence is also lost when the warband requests a Reinforcement Character fight at its side\. This represents the Characters calling favours, debts, or other means to have one of these powerful individuals come to their aid

### Influence Decreases

__Influence Lost__|__Sample Reasons__
---|---
1|Becoming embroiled in a shoot\-out with Hive Desoleum Sanctionaries; failing to exhibit the proper decorum at a formal gathering of the sector’s nobility\.
2|Destroying the sacred thigh bone of Saint Koriel while fighting to defend his basilica\.
3|Failing to prevent the minions of the Callers of Sorrow from releasing a deadly pathogen in the lower levels of Hive Desoleum\.
4|Commandeering a company of Imperial Guard, directly resulting in the loss of a major world to Ork invasion
5|Declaring Exterminatus on a world without proper cause\.

The loss of Influence represents actual shifts in attitudes toward the Character, or a loss of resources\. While it can serve as a simple setback, the loss of Influence can also act as the impetus for exciting encounters or entire game sessions\. If a player wishes to recoup lost Influence through in\-game activities, the GM should try to accommodate this\. For instance, a Character who loses Influence because he failed to save the life of a respected preacher could go before the Ministorum to seek atonement\. This could be represented by an in-depth social encounter, or the GM could use the opportunity as a springboard for a new adventure, giving the Character an opportunity to redeem himself by performing a dangerous task for the deacon.
