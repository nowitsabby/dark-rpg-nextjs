# Creating a Character

## Stage 1: Choose Origin

A character's origin is the planet or location where she was born and likely spent a great deal of her life\. It can determine her physical appearance, mannerisms, and perspective on the Imperium as a whole\. A character's origin also determines her starting characteristics\.

Each origin includes the following special rules that are applied to a character from this origin:

### Characteristic Modifiers

Modifiers that alter how the player generates the Acolyte's starting characteristics\.

To generate a characteristic, the player rolls 2d10, adds the results together, and then adds 20\. The result is the character's characteristic, and the player does this for each of the 10 characteristics, filling in each result on the character's character sheet\. The roll to generate a characteristic can be altered by the characteristic modifiers of the character's home world\. Each modifier lists characteristics with either a “\+” or a “–” in front of it\. These affect the roll in the following ways:

\+ Characteristic: When rolling to determine the specified characteristic, the character rolls 3d10, takes the two dice with highest results, and adds their results to 20 to determine the characteristic\.

– Characteristic: When rolling to determine the specified characteristic, the character rolls 3d10, takes the two dice with lowest results, and adds their results to 20 to determine the characteristic\.

The Player Characters are a cut above the rest of humanity, and fated for a greater destiny\. Because of this, the player can re\-roll any one characteristic value when generating her characteristics, but must keep the second result\.

If the GM and all players agree, players can alternatively perform character generation with adding 25 instead of 20 to reflect more experienced characters ready to face even greater threats\. If so, adjust the values when Allocating Points to start with 30 points, and raise the \+ and – Characteristics by 5\. When using this higher starting score, no characteristic can be raised to a value higher than 45\.

#### Allocating Points

At the GM's discretion, players can instead use point allocations to determine starting characteristics in place of generating the characteristics via dice rolls\. To do this, the character starts with a score of 25 in each characteristic and then receives 60 points which she can distribute to any of her characteristics as desired\. Each point distributed to a characteristic raises that characteristic by one\. No characteristic, however, can be raised to a value higher than 40 in this way\.

When using point allocations, the characteristic modifiers applied from the PC's origin change the starting score of the respective characteristics:

__\+ Characteristic:__ Starts with a score of 30\.

__– Characteristic:__ Starts with a score of 20\.

### Fate Threshold

A value representing the starting Fate threshold of a character from this origin\. A character starts with a threshold equal to the listed value, but has a chance at gaining the “Emperor's Blessing” and increasing the value by 1\. The player rolls 1d10, and compares the result to the Emperor's Blessing value for her origin\. If the result is equal to or higher than the listed value, the player increases her character's Fate threshold by 1\.

### Origin Bonus

A special ability that a character from this origin gains during character creation\. Note that the character does not need to meet the prerequisites for talents granted in this stage\.

### Origin Aptitude

An aptitude that the character gains based on her origin\.

### Wounds

The number of wounds a character possesses at the beginning of the game\. This is commonly a static value plus a die roll\.

## Stage 2: Choose Background

A character's background represents what the character has done with her life up until this point, including the previous organisations under which she served\. It determines what sort of training the character has received throughout her life, what kind of resources she has access to, and who she knows\.

Each player chooses one background type for her character and creates her character's history\. She can either draw on the example background for inspiration—creating a new, unique background history—or leave her character's exact story a mystery for now\. After choosing a background, the character gains the appropriate starting skills and talents, acquires her starting equipment, and gains her background aptitude and special ability\.

Each background includes the following special rules that are applied to a character with this background:

### Skills

A list of skills that the character starts with at the Known \(rank 1\) level, due to her previous life in that background\.

### Background Talents

A list of talents that a character from this background gains at character creation\. Note that the character does not need to meet the normal prerequisites for any talents granted during this stage of character creation\.

### Equipment

A list of weapons, gear, and other items that a character from this background gains at character creation\. All ranged weapons come with two clips of their standard ammunition\.

### Bonuses

A special ability that a character from this background gains\.

### Background Aptitude

A choice of an aptitude that the character gains from this background\.

### Trait

A trait, or list of trait choices, that this character begins play with.

## Stage 3: Choose role

While origin and background determine a character's past, her role determines what she is in the present\. Each character views the world around her and her place in it in a certain manner, which is reflected in her role\. This broadly defines how she faces dangers, interacts with others, and seeks to resolve problems\. Her role also dictates what areas of expertise she excels at, and how she grows and learns with experience\.

Each role includes the following special rules that are applied to a character with this role:

### Role Aptitudes

The aptitudes the character gains from this role during character creation\.

### Role Talents

The talents that a character with this role gains at character creation\. Note that the character does not need to meet the normal prerequisites for talents granted during this stage of character creation\.

### Role Bonus

A unique ability that a character with this role gains during character creation\.

Each player chooses one role for her character, and decides her character's function before and after joining the warband\. After the player chooses her character's role, the character immediately gains the appropriate role special ability\.

## Stage 4: Spend Experience Points, Equip Character

In this stage, each player customises her character's abilities\. Player Characters start the game with a certain amount of experience points \(xp\), usually 1000xp for relatively new characters, to reflect their lives up until this point and can spend these points to increase their characters' initial characteristics, skills, and talents\. Here, they can also purchase additional equipment such as weapons and gear from the Armoury\.

### Spend Experience Points

Spending experience points to increase a character's characteristics, skills, or talents is known as purchasing an Advance. The xp cost of an Advance depends on the aptitudes of the character and the relative power of the Advance. See Advancement for more information.

### Equip Character

Each character starts with certain items based on her background, but can also select additional weapons, equipment, and gear as part of her initial creation\. These represent other accessories the Acolyte brought with her, and help define her favoured combat methods and idiosyncrasies\. An Acolyte can make a number of selections up to her starting Influence bonus value from the Armoury, each of which can have an Availability of Scarce \(–10\) or better\. For example, a character with an Influence of 37 could make up to 3 acquisitions\. Note that all weapons acquired during character creation \(and in regular game play onwards\) come with two clips of standard ammunition\. During regular game play, Acolytes use the normal Requisition system for acquiring additional weapons, gear, armour, and other items from the Armoury\.

## Stage 5: Give the Character Life

Lastly, it is time for each player to give her character the unique personality that sets her apart from her fellow Acolytes\. This stage helps the players define their characters' names, appearances, past, histories with other PCs or important NPCs, and more\.

### Gender, Appearance, and Personal Details

The war\-torn worlds of the 41st Millennium are home to an unfathomable number of different types of people\. A character can have any desired gender, unless the GM or a specific origin or background would preclude such an option otherwise\. The same goes for appearance, which should follow any details made as part of the character's creation, but otherwise be open to free construction\. As a player is creating the appearance of her character, she should keep in mind the descriptions given in the character creation options she has chosen, as those can often give ideas as to how those from that life might appear\. For example, feral worlders are often large and muscular while the servants of the Adeptus Mechanics are usually covered in cybernetics and the red robes of their order\. Many hive worlders are pale, having never seen their sun\. A character from the Adeptus Astra Telepathica could be uncomfortable in crowds, but an Outcast might welcome them as new sources of income\. These are only suggestions, however, as there is no such thing as a typical character\. There are commonalities within origins, backgrounds, and roles, and players should look to them to guide character creation, but fashioning characters with their own unique details can be very rewarding and make for warbands that stand apart\.

### Twist of Destiny

Beyond the choices that have led a character into service for her Inquisitor, that character's strange and twisted destiny has played a large part in her life\. To represent the effects of this winding fate on the character's life, each character must roll 1d100 during character creation and compare the result to the Divinations Table, immediately applying the listed affects\.

#### Divinations Table

### Nature

Once a character's appearance has been determined, and the details of her life worked out, the player should have a good idea of the personality she would like the character to have\. To help in generating a personality for the character, the player can consider the following questions:

#### What Does the Character Desire?

The eternal fight never ends, but each character takes up the cause for her own reasons\. Some characters want only to stay alive, or fight to ensure their loved ones are saved\. Others might be obsessed with power and riches, or the desire to see the sector cleansed of heresy or crime\. Some might be devoted to Mankind's survival, caring little for individual lives so long as the species continues\. A desire could be to gain the favour of a loved one, or even simply to relish a moment of quiet peace with a lho stick and a glass of fine amasec\.

#### What Does the Character Hate?

Hatred can motivate many a character in powerful ways, burning her passions and keeping her fighting when all else is gone\. A character who lost her world to a xenos invasion might be consumed with hate, and eagerly seek out aliens to kill no matter the species or their actual threat\. Another might reserve her wrath for those who do not worship the Emperor in the correct manner, or for foul mutants who defy the holy form of Man\. A character's hatred could also be within herself, for a moment of weakness on an otherwise\-forgotten battlefield that only the Emperor witnessed\.

#### What is the Character Willing to Sacrifice?

For many characters, death is the final sacrifice, and to think otherwise is to turn away from the Emperor\. Some might hold their lives dearly, knowing what might await them when the Emperor makes Her judgement, and willing to sacrifice anything or anyone to forestall that final day\. Others might care little for death, but fear the day their own honour is lost in their pursuits\. When combatting the Ruinous Powers, the loss of their very souls might be the supreme sacrifice to avert an apocalypse\.
