# Insanity

Characters are at the centre of terrible events: battling indescribable horrors, uncovering shocking truths, and engaging in desperate struggles where countless lives and souls hang in the balance\. Such are the stresses and terrors involved that the slow slide into insanity is a constant threat\. No human mind, not even one hardened by the harsh rigours of life in the Imperium, is immune to the slow erosion of sanity by the horrors of the 41st Millennium, and Acolytes are no exception\. These dangers are represented by Insanity points\. These represent the strain put on a character's mind by his experiences; the more Insanity points, the more fragile his mind has become\. The cumulative effects of Insanity points are divided into Traumas, which represent the short term after\-effects of particularly terrible experiences, and Disorders, which are permanent mental afflictions that mark a character's slide into total madness

## Insanity Points

Insanity points \(IsP\) begin at 0 when a PC begins the game and increase over time as damage is done to a character's state of mind. The higher the Insanity Points, the more damaged and debilitated a character becomes, and should IsP ever reach 100, the character is either slain by his Inquisitor or fellow Acolytes for his own good, or falls from grace and becomes an enemy of Mankind\. In either case, he can no longer serve his Inquisitor—he is lost in the eyes of the Emperor and must be retired from play\.

## Degrees of Madness

A character is classified as having a certain degree of Madness depending on how many Insanity points he has accumulated\. This classification gives a player a broad idea of the state of a character's mind and how close to the edge he has become\. A character's degree of Madness also determines the modifier that he applies to tests taken to avoid Mental Trauma\.

## Mental Trauma

Mental Trauma represents the relatively short\-term damage to a character's state of mind that he suffers after experiencing a particularly horrific event\. Each time the character's Insanity point total rises by another 10 points, he must make a Trauma test\. This is a Willpower test, modified in difficulty by how many Insanity points the character has accrued in total See Reference File\. If the character passes the test, he manages to cope with his experience without any ill effect\. If he fails the test, roll on Table Mental Traumas, adding 10 to the roll for every degree of failure\. This result is applied in the aftermath of any encounter that inflicted the Insanity points\.

### Mental Traumas
__Roll__   |__Result__
-------|-------
01–40  |The character becomes withdrawn and quiet. He suffers a –10 penalty to all Fellowship based tests for 3d10 hours.
41–70  |The character must compulsively perform an action (such as fevered praying, frantically cleaning a weapon, etc.) and pays little attention to anything else. He suffers a –10 penalty to all test based on Intelligence, Fellowship, and Perception. This effect lasts for 3d10 hours.
71–100 |The character is constantly fearful, seeing danger everywhere, and is extremely jumpy. The character gains a +10 bonus to all Perception-based tests and is at a –10 penalty to Willpower tests for the next 1d5 days.
101–120|The character suffers from a temporary Severe phobia. This effect lasts for 1d5 days.
121–130|The character reacts to the slightest stress or pressure by becoming extremely agitated. When performing any task that involves a test, the character must first pass a Willpower test or suffer a –10 modifier to the test. During combat encounters, he suffers a –10 penalty on all tests. This effect lasts for 1d5 days.
131–140|The character suffers vivid and extreme nightmares whenever he tries to sleep. The next day, and for a further 1d10 days, the character is exhausted by a lack of sleep and gains 1 level of Fatigue.
141–150|The character is struck dumb and is unable to speak. This lasts for 1d5 days.
151–160|Extremely distressed and unfocused, the character refuses to eat or drink, and looks to be in a terrible state. Reduce all of the character's characteristics by 10 (to a minimum of 1) for 1d10 days.
161–170|The character suffers a fit of hysterics, and becomes temporarily blind or deaf for 1d10 days. 171+ The character becomes completely traumatized and virtually unresponsive. He cannot initiate actions, but can be gently led. This effect lasts for 1d10 days.

## Gaining Mental Disorders

Mental disorders reflect the permanent, long\-term effects on a character's mind of the horrors of the battlefield\. A character automatically gains a new disorder \(or a more severe version of an existing disorder\) each time he acquires a certain number of Insanity points\. A character gains one Minor Disorder when he reaches 40 Insanity points, one Severe Disorder when he reaches 60 Insanity points, and one Acute Disorder when he reaches 80 Insanity points \(these correspond to the character becoming “Disturbed,” “Unhinged,” and “Deranged”\)\. Disorders can be selected by the GM, or the GM can allow the player to select one if he prefers\. A character must have the preceding severity of a disorder for it to get worse, so for a disorder to become “Severe” the character must have the “Minor” version of the disorder first\.

### Disorders and Their Severity

The effect a mental disorder has on a character is left largely up to the GM, though the descriptions presented below provide some guidelines\. If a character finds himself in a situation or encounter where his disorder will be immediately or dangerously detrimental, he can make a Willpower test\. Success means that he is able to ignore the effects of the disorder for the remainder of the encounter\. All disorders are rated as Minor, Severe, or Acute, in ascending order of effect\.

- Minor Disorder: The effects of the disorder manifest rarely or exhibit a fairly weak compulsion\. Any test to overcome the effects of the disorder gains a \+10 bonus\.
- Severe Disorder: The effects of the disorder are stronger and may manifest regularly\. There is no modifier to tests made to overcome the effects of the disorder\.
- Acute Disorder: The effects of the disorder are very strong and will trigger at the slightest stimulation\. Any tests to overcome the effects of the disorder are made a –10 penalty\.

## Removing Insanity

With the GMs permission, a character may use xp to remove Insanity points\. It costs 100 xp to remove a single Insanity point\. A character cannot ever go down a degree of Madness, and so can never lose one of his disorders through this method\. The removal of Insanity points should be properly represented as time and effort spent by the character in game \(long\-term palliative care, prayer, fasting, penance, recuperation in quiet and pleasant surroundings, etc.\)\.

## Only the Insane Shall Prosper\.\.\.

The more insane a character becomes, the less horrific things seem\. After all, what are the horrors of a blood\-soaked sacrifice compared to the terrors an Acolyte sees when he closes his eyes? If the tens digit of a character's Insanity points total is double \(or more\) a creature's Fear level, the character is unaffected by that source of Fear and does not need to make a Fear test\.
