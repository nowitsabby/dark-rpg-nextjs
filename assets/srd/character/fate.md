# Fate Points 

All Acolytes begin play with one or more Fate points, determined during character creation\. At the beginning of each game session, an Acolyte receives her full complement of Fate points, as determined by her Fate Threshold\. During the game, she can spend her Fate points to receive beneficial effects, helping her to succeed where an ordinary person could not\. 

## Fate Threshold 

Fate threshold represents the maximum number of Fate points that an Acolyte can have at any one time\. Fate threshold both limits the number of Fate points available at any time to an Acolyte, and guarantees a number of Fate points at the beginning of each game session\. An Acolyte's total number of Fate points can never exceed her threshold; any Fate points gained in excess of her Fate threshold are lost\. For this reason, it is a good idea for players to not be too stingy with Fate points\. By the same token, though, a player who spends Fate points too freely could find her character without one when she really needs it\. 

### Increasing Fate Threshold 

It is possible, but rare, for an Acolyte's Fate threshold to increase\. The GM can bestow an increase in Fate threshold as a reward for a monumental accomplishment, to represent the unfolding of a great destiny, or perhaps in recognition of a selfless sacrifice on the part of the Acolyte\. The GM should never grant such a reward lightly; Fate points are a powerful resource for players, and a high Fate threshold ensures a character's survival even when facing certain \(and possibly justifiable\) death\. 

## Using Fate Points 

Fate points allow Player Characters to manipulate situations by mitigating bad results or turning a mishap into fortune\. Among other things, this allows players to take more risks, which makes the game faster and far more exciting\. A character has a limited pool of Fate points, and when a Fate point is spent, that number is reduced by one\. Spent Fate points are restored back up to the character's Fate threshold at the beginning of the next gaming session, or possibly, under special circumstances, in the middle of the game session if the GM deems appropriate\. A Fate point can be used at any time, either on the character's own turn or in reaction to the action of another character\. Spending a Fate point is a Free Action, and allows a Player Character to do one of the following: 

- Re\-roll a test\. 
- Gain a \+10 bonus to a test\. This must be chosen before the dice are rolled\. 
- Add 1 degree of success to a successful test\. This may be chosen after the dice are rolled\. 
- Count as having rolled 10 for Initiative\. 
- Instantly remove 1d5 damage from the character\. This cannot be used to remove Critical damage\. 
- Instantly recover from being Stunned\. 
- Remove all levels of Fatigue\. 

## Burning Fate 

When an Acolyte faces certain death, she can choose to burn Fate in order to survive\. This is most often a result of suffering a critical wound in combat, but could also be to survive a fall from a great height, the effects of disease or poison, or even the destruction of a void\-ship which the Acolyte is aboard\. Burning Fate permanently reduces the Acolyte's Fate threshold by 1, and she immediately loses any Fate points in excess of her new threshold\. The Acolyte survives whatever it was that would have killed her, but only just\. Generally, the Acolyte should be left incapacitated and out of the fight, precluding her from taking any further part in the fight, but also ensuring that her enemies overlook her, perhaps believing her to be dead\. In cases where Critical damage was the cause, the Acolyte should likely suffer all of the effects from that result except for the actual inflicting of death\. 

It is up to the GM and the player to work out exactly how the character survives the incident\. In the case of an injury sustained in combat, perhaps a holy icon worn on the Acolyte's breast deflects a blow, or a bullet passes cleanly through her chest, miraculously missing organs\. Other situations, such as a Warp drive implosion, or being on the surface of a world during Exterminatus, require a greater degree of creativity to explain, and should seldom be without some consequence\. 

A player can burn Fate threshold regardless of the number of Fate points her Acolyte currently possesses\. Even a player who has spent all of her Acolyte's Fate points during that session can burn Fate threshold; the Acolyte begins the next session with one less Fate point\. 

## Gaining Fate Points 

There are two primary ways by which an Acolyte can regain spent Fate points\. First, at the beginning of each game session, all characters restore Fate points up to their Fate threshold; in other words, Acolytes begin each session with a number of Fate points equal to their Fate threshold\. Second, the GM can grant Fate points during game sessions as rewards for excellent roleplaying or achieving a major goal in the adventure\. Examples include entertaining in\-character dialogue, taking actions appropriate for the Acolyte that are not necessarily in the player's “best” interests, drawing successful conclusions based on the facts of a case, or an Acolyte risking her life for the sake of the mission or her companions\. Such “bonus” Fate points are never guaranteed, and are always solely at the discretion of the GM\. An Acolyte cannot gain Fate points in excess of her Fate threshold\.
