# Malignancy & Mutation

## The Malignancy Test

For every 10 total Corruption points a character gains, he must make a Willpower test to see if his Corruption has manifested as literal damage to his body and soul\. This roll is modified depending on the number of CP the character already possesses as noted on The Corruption Track\. If the character fails the test, his spiritual Corruption is given form\. These metaphysical and psychosomatic scars are called Malignancies, and are randomly rolled on Table Malignancies\. If a player rolls a result that he has previously suffered for failing a previous Malignancy test, he must roll again until he receives a new result\.

### Malignancies
D100 | Malignancy |Effect
---|---|---
01–10 | Palsy |The character suffers from numerous minor tics, shakes, and tremors with no medical cause. Reduce his Agility by 1d10.
11–15 | Dark-hearted      |The character grows increasingly cruel, callous, and vindictive. Reduce his Fellowship by 1d10.
16–20 | Ill-fortuned      |Chance seems to mock this Acolyte at the most crucial of opportunities. Whenever this character uses a Fate point, roll 1d10. On a result of 7–10, the Fate point has no effect but is spent anyway.
21–25 | Skin Afflictions  |The character is plagued by boils, scabs, weeping sores and other disgusting features across his body. He suffers a –20 penalty to all Charm tests.
26–30 | Night Eyes        |Light pains the character, echoing the growing stain on his soul. Unless he shields his eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty on all tests made in an area of bright light.
31–33 | Morbid            |The character finds it hard to concentrate as his mind turns increasingly macabre and he becomes prone to tortured, gloom filled trains of thought. Reduce his Intelligence by 1d10.
34–45 | Witch-Mark        |The character develops some minor physical deformity or easily concealable mutation. It is small, but perhaps enough to consign him to death if found out by a fanatical witch hunter.
46–50 | Fell Obsession    |This functions like the Obsession Disorder, but in this case the character is obsessed by something sinister or malign (such as collecting finger-bone trophies, ritual scarification, carrying out meaningless vivisections, etc.).
51–55 | Irrational Nausea |The character feels sick at the sight, sound, or smell of something otherwise innocuous (such as prayer books and holy items, bare flesh, human laughter, fresh food, etc.). When he encounters an object of his revulsion he must make a Toughness test or suffer a –10 penalty to all tests as long as he remains in its presence.
56–60 | Wasted Frame      |The character's pallor becomes corpse-like and his muscles waste away. Reduce his Strength by 1d10.
61–63 | Night Terrors     |The character is plagued by daemonic visions in his sleep. This functions identically to the Horrific Nightmares Disorder.
64–70 | Poor Health       |The character constantly suffers petty illnesses and phantom pains, and his wounds never seem to fully heal. Reduce the character's Toughness by 1d10.
71–75 | Distrustful       |The character cannot conceal the distrust and antipathy he has for others. He suffers a –10 penalty to Fellowship tests when dealing with strangers.
76–80 | Malign Sight      |The world seems to darken, tarnish, and rot if the character looks at anything too long. Reduce the character's Perception by 1d10.
81–83 | Ashen Taste       |Food and drink taste foul and provide little sustenance to the character, and he can barely stomach eating. Recovering levels of Fatigue takes twice as long for him than normal.
84–90 | Bloodlust         |Murderous rage is never far from the character's mind. After suffering damage (after Armour and Toughness bonus) in combat, he must succeed at a Willpower test to allow his enemies to flee, be captured, or incapacitated, rather than killing them outright, even if his intent is otherwise.
91–93 | Blackouts         |The character suffers from inexplicable blackouts. When they occur and what happens during them is up to the Game Master, who should inform the player the details of what (if anything) he remembers on awakening.
94–100 | Strange Addiction |The character has a near-uncontrollable craving for some bizarre and unnatural substance (such as rose petals, fresh blood, widows' tears, etc.). This acts like a Minor Disorder for Compulsion, but is freakish enough to cause serious suspicion if discovered.

## Mutation

A character's Corruption points total is also used to determine the terrible effects of Chaos upon his body\. As his Corruption builds, his flesh may revolt, twisted by the Dark Gods\. Of course, such is the insidious nature of Chaos that it is constantly hunting for weakness in mind and body, testing a character's defences until it can find a way into his soul\. For every 30 Corruption points a character gains, he must make a test against two Characteristics of his choice\. *He can never test against the same characteristics twice to resist mutation, and should make a note on his Character Sheet of which characteristics he has already used to resist mutation\.*

Failure on either test means he suffers a mutation\. The unfortunate Acolyte rolls a 1d100 to gain a random mutation from Table Mutations\. Should this give him a mutation he already possesses, he must roll again until it results in a fresh mutation\.

Note that the GM can alternatively select specific mutations and malignancies, to represent unique daemonic energies or the influences of Warp\-tainted artefacts\. He can also choose to simply apply specific traits as a mutation result, especially Amphibious, Blind, Burrower, Darksight, Fear, Multiple Arms, Natural Armour, Natural Weapons, Quadruped, Regeneration, Size \(increase or decrease by one\), Sonar Sense, or Toxic\.

### Mutations
__D100__                 |__Effect__
--------------------------|--------------------------
01–06 Bestial Hide        |The character's skin becomes toughened with layers of thick scales or chitin, and he gains the Natural Armour (2) trait.
07–11 Unnatural Arms      |Twisted appendages (shriveled arms, hooked talons, or fleshy tendrils) emerge from this character's spine or torso. He gains the Multiple Arms (CB) trait.
12–17 Sightless Orbs      |This character's eyes become sightless, cracked windows into a soul afflicted with a growing corruption. He gains the Blind and Unnatural Senses (CBx10) traits.
18–25 Swollen Brute       |This character becomes bloated, his muscles expanding and his form becoming excessively corpulent or disturbingly muscular (or perhaps both). This character's Toughness and Strength characteristics are permanently increased by 10, but his Agility bonus is reduced by 1 for purposes of movement.
26–30 Deathsight          |This character's mind becomes twisted, his eyes showing him countless possible annihilations of anything or anyone he gazes upon for more than a few moments. Once per game session, this character may increase the damage of one attack he has made by his Corruption bonus. If he does so, he gains 1 Corruption point.
31–36 Cursed Fleshmetal   |This character's armour and cybernetic implants become fused with his flesh, and even regenerate. Removing any of these items requires a Challenging (+0) Medicae test; if the test fails, he suffers 1d5 Rending damage to a randomly selected limb that ignores Armour. He can make an Ordinary (+10) Toughness test to repair items merged with him, in the same manner as a Tech-Use test to repair the same equipment, but suffers 1 Corruption point.
37–43 Razor Fangs         |This character's teeth grow long, turning into tearing fangs. This character gains an unarmed attack that inflicts 1d5+CB Rending damage, pen 2. He permanently reduces his Fellowship characteristic by 1d5.
44–49 Excessive Legs      |This character develops extra legs that support his form, suspending his upper torso above a centauroid lower body. This character gains the Quadruped trait with a number of extra legs equal half to his Corruption bonus (rounded up).
50–54 Wings               |Massive feathered or leathery wings erupt from this character's spine, and he gains the Flyer (CB x 2) trait.
55–60 Serpentine Tail     |This character's legs wither while his spine elongates into a serpentine tail that supports his body. He gains the Crawler trait and gains an unarmed attack that can strike for 1d10 Impact damage, Pen 0.
61–69 Searing Blood       |This character's veins are filled with searing acids in place of blood, though somehow the corrosive effects do not burn his own flesh. Whenever he suffers Blood Loss, the foul liquid erupts and inflicts 1d5+CB Energy damage, Pen 0, to each other character within 1d5 metres.
70–77 Witch-Curse         |A small stigma in the shape of a maddening rune appears on this character's body, marking him as touched by Chaos. He gains the Psyker trait (or adds 1 to an existing psy rating) and freely learns any 1 psychic power that costs 100 xp or less. Whenever he attempts to use this power, he gains 1d5 Corruption points.
78–84 Bone-Blades         |This character's bones grow long, twisted spurs that sprout painfully from his flesh on his command. This character gains an unarmed attack that inflicts 1d10+CB Rending damage, Pen 0. Whenever he makes an attack with this weapon, this character suffers Blood Loss unless he passes a Challenging (+0) Toughness test.
85–89 Cannibalistic Urge  |Blood and marrow become as wine and bread to this character, and normal food no longer sates the hunger of his soul. Once per game session, he can remove 1d5 damage by consuming human flesh. Each time he does so, he gains 1 Corruption point.
90–92 Corrupted Flesh     |Instead of blood, when this character's flesh is torn asunder, horrific insects, worms, or flitting creatures spill forth. Whenever he suffers damage, this character gains the Fear (1) trait for 1d5 rounds.
93–94 It Will Not Die!    |This character is touched by the power of the Warp, and fortune twists to keep him alive regardless of the terrible wounds he suffers, as if it is the will of some dark being that resides beyond the veil of reality. He can no longer burn a Fate point to survive lethal injuries. Whenever this character would die, he instead survives by the narrowest margin as if he had burned a Fate point and gains 1d10+5 Corruption points.
95–97 Warp Gaze           |Whatever this character looks upon burns with the fire of the Warp, and all who see his eyes despair. This character gains a 20m ranged attack that strikes with 1d10+CB Energy damage and the Spray quality. Each time he uses this attack, he gains 1d5 Corruption points. Characters struck with this attack must make a Challenging (+0) Fear (1) test.
98–99 Warp Regeneration   |Corruption seethes through this character's flesh, sewing his body back together time and time again whether he wills it or not. Whenever this character suffers damage, he makes a Challenging (+0) Toughness test. If he succeeds, he gains the Regeneration (CB) trait for 1 round and gains 1d5 Corruption points.
100 The Warp Made Manifest|This character becomes a Daemon-like creature, capable of reshaping reality itself at his whim. He gains the Daemonic (CB), Fear (2), From Beyond, and Warp Instability traits. He can also use his Willpower characteristic in place of any other characteristic for any test he is called upon to take.
