## Nomadic Houses	

Some of the Great Houses have forsaken ties of sector and system, relinquishing their terrestrial holdings. Instead, over the centuries, these Navigator Houses have taken wholly to the stars to become wanderers and gypsies, their lines preserved on vast fleets of ships constantly on the move. To be part of a Nomadic House is to be born between the stars and spurn the life of a dirt dweller. It is also this long term exposure to both the void and the Immaterium that hones the skills of Navigators from Nomadic Houses, giving them an understanding of space and warp second to none. 

Some Nomadic Houses known to travel the Expanse include Term'L, Xan'Tai and Aleene.

A Navigator character that belongs to a Nomadic House gains the following benefits:

#### Lore of the Wanderer
The Navigator has an ingrained affinity with passage between distant and uncharted stars and gains the Talented (Navigation (Warp)) Talent. 
#### A Taste for the Warp
Living in constant contact with the veil between real space and the warp, the Navigator can read it like few others. The Navigator can spend a Fate Point to automatically succeed in using a Navigator power; if degrees of success are relevant to the effects of the power, he will succeed by 1d5 degrees of success with 5 counting as 0 degrees of success. 
#### Scorn of Dirt Dwellers
Those that have roamed the void for so long feel uncomfortable in the cultures of dirt dwellers and usually cannot wait to return to space. Whenever the Navigator is on a planetary body and must deal with locals he suffers a –10 to all Fellowship tests and skills based on Fellowship. 
#### Initial Mutation
Navigators from a Nomadic House begin play with a single Navigator Mutation rolled randomly from Table Navigator Mutations. They may develop additional mutations as normal when they acquire new Navigator Powers or increase their mastery of existing powers.

## Magisterial Houses	

Greatest in size and power are the Magisterial Houses. The roots of the original Navigator families, these Houses maintain mighty palaces on Terra and their influence reaches to the very edges of the light of the Astronomican. The Magisterial Houses maintain traditions and practices that have served them for millennia. They are masters of the traditional Navigator crafts and have more control over the malign mutations that afflict those with the gene. To be part of a Magisterial House is to know without question the purity of your blood and the ancient power and nobility of your family. 

Magisterial Houses with influence in the Expanse include the grand houses of Benetek and Vor'cle.

A Navigator character that belongs to a Magisterial House gains the following benefits

#### Warp Focus
The warp eye is the core of a Navigator's being and his oldest and most potent tool. Once per game session he may force a single opponent to re-roll a successful test when testing to resist the effects of The Lidless Stare Navigator Power. 
#### Resistant Genes
The Navigators of a Magisterial House are less likely to mutate due to their carefully cultivated genes. Whenever they must test for mutation the test is considered Routine (+20) rather than Ordinary (+10). 
#### Exalted Lineage
The blood of the most ancient and powerful navigator houses gifts their scions with a position of prestige amongst the nobility of the Imperium. The Navigator may call upon this lineage in social situations and gains a +10 bonus to any Interaction Skill Test when dealing with members of the Imperial nobility. 
#### Initial Mutation
Navigators from a Magisterial House begin play with a single Navigator Mutation chosen from the following options: Strangely Jointed Limbs, Elongated Form, Pale and Hairless Flesh, Eyes as Dark as the Void. They may develop additional mutations as normal when they acquire new Navigator Powers or increase their mastery of existing powers.

## Shrouded Houses

Shrouded houses have suffered great losses or shame within the more established dominions of the Imperium. They have opted to move their powerbase completely to the edge of known space, where they cling to the barest strands of their former status and power. Though they may be rich in skill, knowledge or lore, something in the past of Shrouded Houses has blighted them and reduced them to a state so far from their once exalted position that they are sometimes cruelly called ‘beggar houses' by their more successful counterparts. To be part of a Shrouded House is to be part of a fallen line that is slowly rising again to stand defiant against those that once cast them down—or at least, so you are told by your elders. Their loss in standing has often forced such houses to flee to the margins of the Imperium and to develop a cunning and opportunistic mindset alongside a skill that is often lacked by more comfortably indolent houses.

Some of the more powerful and influential include the Modar, Yeshar, and the Rey'a'Nor triumvirate as well as the notorious Cedd house.

A Navigator character that belongs to a Shrouded House gains the following benefits:

#### Destitute
The navigator's fortunes are so low that he has little or nothing and is initially a drain on the resources of his fellows. The presence of a navigator from a Shrouded Lineage reduces the group's starting Profit Factor, or their individual Influence, by –1. 
#### A Gaze to Pierce the Soul
The Navigator has a keen understanding of a person's relationship to the warp born of enforced self-reliance and bitter musings. The Navigator begins play with Gaze into the Abyss as a bonus power. In addition, he may raise this ability above Master to Paragon (the xp cost is the same as to raise to Master) giving him a +30 bonus on all tests with this power. 
#### Mercantile Opportunists
Raised in a volatile atmosphere where the need for profit and advancement outweighed all other concerns, these Navigators have had to learn the hard way the skills of hard bargaining and contract hunting—needs most of their kind are normally sheltered from. The Navigator gains a +10 bonus to tests with the Commerce and Charm Skills. 
#### Initial Mutation
Navigators from a Shrouded House begin play with a single Navigator Mutation rolled randomly from Table Navigator Mutations. They may develop additional mutations as normal when they acquire new Navigator Powers or increase their mastery of existing powers.

## Renegade Houses

Some of the Great Houses have completely forsaken the traditions and ancient practices of the Navigator families in their quest for power, or may have been turned on by the rest of the Navis Nobilite, harrowed, and driven into exile. Dabbling heavily in the genes of their children in order to improve their lot, their tampering often leads to hideous mutations and unconscionable monsters in their lineage, which in turn leads to rejection by the Paternova and a hunt to extinction by the Inquisition. In some cases, however, it has birthed new strains of the gene and given rise to families with unique abilities and potent powers. To be a part of a Renegade House is to have cast aside the sacred Navigator traditions as small minded and restrictive and instead embraced the glory and limitless potential of your ancestry—or so the houses believe, to comfort themselves.

It is whispered that the Expanse is home to several Renegade Houses like the secretive Gazmati and the infamous Nostromo.

A Navigator character that belongs to a Renegade House gains the following benefits:

#### The Fruits of Corrupted Blood
In tampering with the fundamental nature of their bloodlines the Renegade Houses have created both monsters and marvels. The Navigator begins play with an additional Navigator Power. Additionally, the Navigator may also choose three Navigator Powers; these may include powers he does not yet have, but plans to later acquire. He gains a +10 bonus to all tests with these powers (in addition to bonuses for being an Adept or Master). In addition, all tests by others to resist these powers suffer a –10 penalty. 
#### Unchecked Mutation
The Navigator is more prone to mutation and mental instability that any others of his kind, representing the tampering of his family line and a life overshadowed by doom. When taking tests for mutation for gaining a new power or increasing an existing one, his tests are Challenging (+0) rather than Ordinary (+10) and he begins play with 1d5 Insanity points. 
#### Renegades
The price of dabbling in the unknown is high, and it has cost the Renegade Houses in both security and status. Navigators from Renegade Houses begin play with 1d5 Corruption points and the watchful eye of the Inquisition ever waiting to uncover wrongdoing. Also, all tests that involve interacting with the official bodies of the Imperium are at a –10 penalty. 
#### Initial Mutation
Navigators from a Renegade House begin play with two Navigator Mutations rolled randomly from Navigator Mutations. They may develop additional mutations as normal when they acquire new Navigator Powers or increase their mastery of existing powers.
