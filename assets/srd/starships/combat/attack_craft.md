# Attack Craft

Often ill-favoured by the command staff of Battlefleet Calixis due to a preference for "true" warships, carrier vessels like the Dictator-class cruiser are nonetheless a valuable strategic asset for the Imperial Navy, simply due to their versatility. The average launch bay on a cruiser-few smaller vessels can spare the internal volume needed to support attack craft operations-carries an assortment of craft, from an abundance of cargo lighters and personnel shuttles, to larger troop dropships, atmospheric craft (sometimes in storage containers, sometimes with limited void-capability for orbital deployment) to anti-ship heavy bombers, assault boats and fighters. This sheer abundance of different craft allows carriers to undertake a wide variety of missions either directly or in support of other vessels.

While they are only grudgingly tolerated by many Imperial Navy Battlefleets, numerous Rogue Traders find carriers to be ideal for their purposes, able to as easily serve mercantile interests as military ones. The only factor limiting their spread amongst such eclectic individuals is cost; maintaining dozens of light craft and the skilled crew needed to maintain and operate them is beyond the resources of all but the wealthiest individuals.

## Launch Bay Preparation

Operating a carrier is a complex matter, and many vessels employ a dedicated crew to oversee the minutia of these operations. No launch bay remains at a constant level of complete readiness. Craft are ritually placed into hangar-vaults, their machine spirits slumbering until they are called upon once more, while the deck crews work to ensure that the launch mechanisms and fuel systems function properly, check the ammunition stores, and perform a thousand other minor tasks needed to ensure that the launch bay works smoothly. Preparing a launch bay for operations is a complex process requiring many men to unload and awaken the craft needed, and to ensure that they are fuelled and armed as required.

Outside of battle, this can be done slowly and carefully, taking the time necessary to ensure that no mistakes are made. This is fortunate, as many shuttles and lighters are stubborn and recalcitrant in spirit compared to the fierce and eager spirits of attack craft, and thus take some time to coerce into service. A starship may have one squadron per point of Launch Bay Strength prepared and ready for launch at any one time.

In the midst of battle, things are a little more hectic, and preflight preparations are afforded much less time. In combat, this takes an Extended Action in which the character performing the Extended Action makes an Ordinary (+10) Command Test in order to make new squadron ready for operations. The maximum number of squadrons that may be made ready simultaneously is equal to the Strength value of the Launch Bay Component being used. Multiple Launch Bay Components may be made ready with a single Extended Action. For more information on what squadrons a launch bay may hold, see "Room in Launch Bays".

Most attack craft operations begin the operation by launching attack craft squadrons currently ready in the launch bays. Once a bay has launched squadrons, additional squadrons can be readied for operations-so long as the number of squadrons readied does not exceed the Strength of the Launch Bay. These squadrons can even be launched on subsequent turns. Needless to say, a ship cannot launch more squadrons than it possesses.

The craft contained within a launch bay can be grouped into five categories for this purpose:

-   Support Craft (small craft designed to support diplomatic and mercantile operations).
-   Aeronautica (small craft designed to support planetary military operations, including atmospheric fighters, bombers, and troop transports).
-   Fighters (void-capable craft designed to combat enemy attack craft and ordnance).
-   Bombers (large void-capable craft designed to attack enemy starships).
-   Assault Boats (void-capable armoured shuttles designed to deliver boarding parties onto enemy vessels).

The specifics of using Support Craft and Aeronautica are not given here, but during any endeavour in which such craft are useful, the players earn an additional +25 Achievement Points towards a Military or Trade objective for every point of launch bay Strength their ship possesses.

## Squadrons Below Full Strength

Depending on the fortunes of war, ships may lose attack craft, and be forced to fight with squadrons that are at less than full strength. Determining how many craft a squadron is missing depends on how losses to attack craft squadrons are being tracked. In any case, squadrons that are half strength or lower only provide the +5 bonus (whether attacking with fighters, bombers, or assault craft) for every two additional squadrons, rather than every one.

## Eliminated Squadrons

Throughout these rules, there is a possibility a squadron may be "eliminated." This means the squadron has lost some of its craft, and others may have been damaged. For game purposes, an "eliminated" squadron cannot operate in the remainder of the Space Combat they were involved in. (At the GM's discretion and in cases of particularly long combat, this can be changed to a period of two hours, while repairs are made and new craft are activated).

Once the combat is over, eliminated squadrons can be restored to active duty.

## Small Craft 

As with torpedoes, starships carry a finite supply of small craft, although they often are equipped with large stocks of spare parts, and may even scavenge damaged and derelict interceptors and bombers after battles to refit and reuse them. However, being an attack craft pilot is an extraordinarily dangerous job. The number of possible ways a pilot may meet his end is considerable, and it is no surprise that the Navy's pilots are a superstitious lot, adorning their craft in lucky trinkets, holy relics and non-regulation paint-jobs all intended to bring fortune and longevity to their pilots. There are two ways to track the losses in starship squadrons-the Abstract Method and the Detailed Method.

**Abstract Method:** If the GM and players don't want to track numbers and losses, they can simply elect to make an Upkeep Test for each eliminated attack craft squadron at the end of the battle, using normal Acquisition Test rules. If they fail the Upkeep Test, the squadron counts as half strength. If they fail the Upkeep Test for a half strength squadron, it has been destroyed-the one or two remaining attack craft and their pilots distributed amongst other squadrons to bolster their numbers.

**Detailed Method:** If the GM and players prefer to keep detailed track of their starships, they can use the following method. For every attack craft squadron eliminated, by whatever means, roll 1d10, then subtract the first digit of the squadron's carrier's Crew Rating. The result is how many attack craft were destroyed, up to the maximum number in the squadron. The remainder are simply damaged or out of ammunition. For example, if a carrier with a Crew Rating of 30 had one of its squadrons eliminated, the Explorer commanding the wave rolls 1d10. He gets a "5," then subtracts "3" (the first digit in the carrier's Crew Rating). The result, "2," is how many fighters were actually destroyed. The remainder made it back to base safely.

Once a squadron has lost half its ships, it counts as half strength. Once all ships are lost, it is destroyed. Losses can be replaced using Acquisition Tests.

## Room in Launch Bays 

It is entirely possible that a Rogue Trader won't have a myriad types of small craft available in his launch bay. Such vehicles are extremely expensive, and a Rogue Trader may not see the value in maintaining squadrons of assault boats when all he wants are starfighter interceptors to protect his vessel.

Each point of Strength in a launch bay equates to enough room for one squadron of starfighters, one squadron of bombers, and one squadron of assault boats, support craft, or Aeronautica. These berths can be refurbished to handle different types of small craft, so a launch bay with one point of Strength could be modified to hold two squadrons of fighters and one squadron of support craft, or any number of other combinations. However, for every point of Strength in a launch bay, the bay can hold three squadrons total.

The size value of squadrons give an idea of how many fighters, bombers, and assault boats may be stored within a launch bay. For support craft and Aeronautica, use the following guidelines:

In general, Aeronautica can be grouped by type in the same way spaceborn attack craft are-fighters, bombers, and transports. However, Aeronautica are generally smaller than their spaceborn cousins. A squadron of Aeronautica can be up to twice the size of a corresponding spaceborn attack craft-so a wing of 40 Thunderbolt fighters would take up the same space as a squadron of 20 Fury Interceptors.

In general, support craft take up the same space as assault boats.

## Ships Without Launch Bays 

Not every starship has dedicated launch bays to host whole squadrons of attack craft and shuttles. However, most starships have some sort of landing bay with room for shuttles and small craft. Generally, Imperial ships are too large to easily land on a planet's surface, and small craft become vital for loading crew and cargo, and resupplying the vessel.

The size of these small bays can vary wildly based on a ship's size and class. However, if GMs or players wish to determine how many shuttles a ship may have room for, a useful guideline is that a ship has room for one lighter, shuttle, or heavy lifter for every 5 points of Space its hull has. In general, these vehicles shouldn't be larger than 50 metres. However, if a ship has a cargo hold component (such as the Cargo Hold and Lighter Bay), they should be able to hold an additional four vehicles.

## Craft Ratings 

The types of fighter craft are many and varied. Each spacefaring race approaches fighter craft design differently, and often a single race has several different types of attack craft for different duties. The Imperium, for example, uses the Fury for space superiority, the Starhawk for anti-ship attacks, and the Shark for hit and run raids. All of these small craft have different capabilities, performance tolerance, and effectiveness. In space combat, this is represented by Craft Rating. Craft Rating is a way to represent the performance of a type of attack craft. It is an abstract value representing an attack craft's manoeuvrability, firepower, and durability. This value is represented by a bonus added to certain Tests made when fighters, bombers, and assault boats make attacks. If the GM wants to use an attack craft that does not have a Craft Rating, he can use its Manoeuvrability instead.

## Fighter Operations

Often seen as glory-obsessed and reckless, fighter pilots are nonetheless skilled at their profession, putting their relatively light craft into the maelstrom of combat to take down massively destructive torpedoes and lumbering bombers capable of damaging immense starships. In the broadest of terms, fighters are used in three roles during space combat. These are described below:

## Interception

As an Extended Action, any number of fighter squadrons currently ready within a ship's launch bays may launch and commence an intercept operation. The fighter squadrons may be grouped up into one or more wings consisting of two or more squadrons, or may operate as independent squadrons, in any combination, as desired. Upon launch and again at the beginning of their parent vessel's subsequent Strategic Turns, the fighter wings may move freely a number of VUs up to the speed of the slowest squadron in the unit. They may continue to remain away from their carrier in this manner for no more than four Strategic Turns, as fuel and life support supplies begin to run low and the fighters are forced to return to their carrier. Squadrons on intercept operations may attack any enemy torpedoes or attack craft within 1VU of their position (whether they enter this range during their movement or enemies enter range during their own turns). Fighter attacks are described later in this section.

## Combat Void Patrol

Commonly referred to as CVP, squadrons of fighters patrol the space around a vessel to protect it from enemy attack. As an Extended Action, any number of fighter squadrons currently ready within a ship's launch bays may commence a CVP operation. A CVP operation may be assigned to the fighters' own carrier or any friendly vessel within a distance equal to the speed of the slowest squadron in the patrol of the carrier, which must remain within that distance while the patrol continues. A patrol can remain in effect indefinitely, as squadrons return to their carrier to resupply periodically as a normal part of the operation. While the CVP remains in effect, any enemy attack craft or torpedoes that move within 5VUs of the patrolled ship are immediately attacked by half of the squadrons performing the patrol (rounding up). The remaining squadrons are either rearming at the time, or are elsewhere on the patrol route. Unlike intercept operations, attacking does not force squadrons to return to their carrier to rearm; such activities are a normal part of CVP operations, and thus the patrol continues even after it has attempted to repel an attack. Spent fighters return to the carrier, rearm, and re-launch on a continuous basis.

## Escort

Instead of operating alone, fighters can be assigned to support bombers or assault boats, protecting them from enemy fighters and harassing defensive turrets to allow their larger brethren to deliver their payloads. Fighter escorts are launched as part of normal bombing or assault boat operations, and move at the same speed as the attack craft they escort. Should the bombers/assault boats be attacked by enemy fighters, then the escorting fighters may attack the enemy fighters. The enemy fighters must engage the escort fighters (see "Attacking with Fighters" below). Against defensive turrets, each squadron of escorting fighters impose a -10 penalty on the turrets' Ballistic Skill Test, and will be shot down before any of the escorted bombers/assault boats.

## Attacking with Fighters

In all cases, where fighters are required to attack enemy small craft, both sides make a Challenging (+0) Command+Craft Rating Test (this will either be from a character aboard the carrier, or from a character leading the fighters personally), with the enemy small craft. Both sides gain a +5 bonus for every squadron of friendly fighters after the first. Both sides also gain a +5 bonus for an additional squadron of bombers or assault craft after the first, plus an additional +5 for each additional two squadrons of bombers or assault craft (as neither bombers nor assault craft are as good at dogfighting as fighters, but are armed and dangerous in numbers). This counts as an Opposed Skill Test, but is not resolved in the same way.

For every degree of success scored on the Test, one opposing squadron or torpedo is "eliminated;" destroyed, damaged or forced to expend their remaining fuel and ammo reserves, and must return to the carrier for rearming and refuelling by the most reasonable direct route. Any remaining squadrons remain in play and can act in later turns, either breaking off and heading for their original target, or staying and engaging. *However, if one side scores at least four degrees of success more than their opponent did, none of that side's squadrons are eliminated no matter what their opponent rolled*. The tactical acumen and impressive piloting skills of the squadron leader's pilots means they scythed through their opposition effortlessly. Craft Rating is essentially an abstract representation of the combat effectiveness of a fighter craft, in terms of weapons, armour, manoeuvrability, and speed.

## Follow My Lead! 

In some instances, Explorers will want to lead attack craft operations themselves. This adds a little additional complication to the process, but also allows these operations to be significantly more successful.

These rules are intended to be a slightly more abstract option than the vehicle rules, allowing dogfights and piloting to take place in the large context of starship combat.

Through a mixture of personal skill, outrageous daring and sheer luck, the Explorer leads his subordinates against the enemy, providing a powerful example for them to follow. While piloting a fighter, bomber or assault boat (as appropriate for the squadrons he is leading), the Explorer makes an Opposed Challenging (+0) Operate (Aeronautica)+Craft Rating Test before the Command Test for the squadrons' attack (using the Operate (Aeronautica) Skill of the opposing squadrons, which for NPCs is usually their ship's Crew Rating). If this is successful, then he grants a +5 bonus, plus an additional +5 for every two degrees of success he wins by, to the subsequent Command Test. Additionally, each two degrees of success indicates that the Explorer has shot down one enemy craft, turret, or torpedo personally in the ensuing combat. This has no specific additional effects, but gives the pilot something to brag about.

However, if he loses by four or more degrees, then a costly mistake disables his vessel and leaves him stranded in the void. The character suffers 2d10+5 damage, reduced by Toughness Bonus and Armour as normal, from the damage to his craft and cannot participate in any further actions until he has been rescued and brought back to the ship.

Alternatively, if the enemy flight is led by a particularly skillful or notorious pilot, the Explorer can elect to duel with him in the void. This is an Opposed Operate (Aeronautica)+Craft Rating Test. The winner gains a +5 bonus, plus an additional +5 for every two degrees of success, to the subsequent Command Test. In addition, if the Explorer wins by three or more degrees, he shoots down the opposing pilot. If he loses by three or more degrees, he suffers the penalty for failing as listed above.

## Bomber Operations

Massive and lumbering compared to other attack craft, bombers carry vast arrays of energy weapons, missiles and bombs designed to damage the thick armoured hulls of starships. With a skilled crew, a bomber can be devastating, using deft manoeuvring to deliver their payload to the weakest parts of a vessel with a degree of precision that cannot be matched by longer-ranged weaponry. As an Extended Action, all bomber squadrons currently ready within a ship's launch bays may begin a bombing operation. The bomber squadrons may be grouped up into one or more wings consisting of two or more squadrons, or may operate as independent squadrons, in any combination, as desired. Upon launch and again at the beginning of their parent vessel's subsequent Strategic Turns, the bomber wings may move freely a number of VUs up to the speed of the slowest squadron in the unit. They may continue to operate away from their carrier for no more than six Strategic Turns (four if the wings include fighters), as fuel and life support supplies begin to run low and the bombers are forced to return to their carrier. Upon moving within 1VU of an enemy vessel, the bombers may commence an attack run, closing quickly upon their target to deliver their payload before retreating back to the carrier.

Make a Challenging (+0) Command+Craft Rating Test (this will either be from a character aboard the carrier, or from a character leading the bombers personally), gaining a +5 bonus for every squadron of friendly bombers after the first. A successful test causes a single hit upon the enemy vessel, with an additional hit for every degree of success. This is up to a maximum of three hits, plus one additional maximum hit for every additional bomber squadron after the first. If the bombing run scores at least four degrees of success, the target also suffers a Critical Hit. Roll 1d5 on the Critical Hit chart and apply the result.

Each hit deals 1d10+4 damage. Add together the damage rolled from each hit, and then subtract from that the armour value of the target ship. Bomber attacks ignore void shields. If, for any reason, the target ship has multiple armour values (such as from the Armoured Prow Component), then the lowest armour value is always used. The final total is the number of points of Hull Integrity the target ship loses.

After delivering their payload, the bombers withdraw to their carrier to refuel and rearm.

## Torpedo bombers

Certain rare vessels have been known to carry a variant of normal bombers known collectively as torpedo bombers. Each torpedo bomber forgoes its normal payload in favour of a single comparatively small torpedo, which it can launch at any point. While seldom as destructive as a true bombing run, the technique can allow for torpedo attacks to come from an unexpected angle.

Instead of performing bombing runs, Torpedo Bombers may, at the start of any turn instead of their normal movement, launch their torpedoes. The torpedoes immediately move directly forwards in whatever direction the bombers were facing, following all the normal rules for torpedoes. Each torpedo bomber can launch one torpedo. A squadron of torpedo bombers is comprised of three torpedo bombers.

Torpedo bombers can launch any type of torpedo, however any torpedo launched from a torpedo bomber has its range halved, as the bombers cannot haul torpedoes with a full load of fuel. In addition, due to their rarity, Acquisition Tests to acquire bombers with torpedo fittings suffer a -5 penalty in addition to any other modifiers. There is also the matter of storing the torpedoes if the starship does not have the stowage that comes with a Torpedo Tube Component. A typical Munitorium can store nine torpedoes on a ship of light cruiser size or larger, or six on a smaller vessel. One could also store a comparable number in a cargo hold, but the lack of safe storage means the torpedoes have a 25% chance of detonating should that Component become damaged or destroyed (see page 37 for rules on what this might do to a vessel).

## Assault Boat Operations

Blunt and unsubtle-looking craft, assault boats are a form of heavily-armoured shuttle designed to carry large boarding parties onto enemy ships. Assault boat prows are typically fitted with an array of high-energy cutting devices, explosive charges, mechanical drills, claws and other tools for breaching the hull of an enemy vessel, behind which are bulky blast doors leading into a transport compartment filled with eager armsmen.

As an Extended Action, any number of assault boat squadrons currently ready within a ship's launch bays may begin an assault operation. The assault boat squadrons may be grouped up into one or more wings consisting of two or more squadrons, or may operate as independent squadrons, in any combination, as desired. Upon launch and again at the beginning of their parent vessel's subsequent Strategic Turns, the assault boat wings may move freely a number of VUs up to the speed of the slowest squadron in the unit. They may continue to remain away from their carrier in this manner for no more than four turns, as fuel and life support supplies begin to run low and the assault boats are forced to return to their carrier. Upon moving within 1VU of an enemy vessel, the assault boats may commence an attack run, closing quickly upon their target to deliver their payload before retreating back to the carrier.

Make a Challenging (+0) Command+Craft Rating Test (this will either be from a character aboard the carrier, or from a character leading the assault boats personally), gaining a +5 bonus for every squadron of friendly bombers after the first. A successful test means that a single assault boat squadron has reached the ship and breached the hull, with an additional assault boat landing for every degree of success, up to a maximum equal to the number of assault boat squadrons attacking that survived any defensive fire. The character leading the boarding parties (if an Explorer is piloting an assault boat, he may not also lead the boarding parties) then begins a Hit and Run Action against the target, ignoring the Operate (Aeronautica) Test and gaining a +10 for every assault boat squadron that successfully landed.

After delivering their payload, the assault boats withdraw to their carrier with any survivors by the shortest expedient route.
