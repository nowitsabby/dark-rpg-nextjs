# Firing Starship Weapons

Starship weapons in the 41st millennium are as varied as the ships that carry them. Lasers, plasma projectors, macrocannons, rocket launchers, terra-watt beam weapons, and more esoteric weaponry such as grav-culverins and gamma emitters, all can be found in a starship's broadside. In game terms, the weapons on starships are Supplemental Components and can be divided into distinct classes; macrobatteries, lances, torpedoes, and nova cannons.

When firing a Weapon Component, the character directing the fire makes a Ballistic Skill Test, adding in any appropriate modifier. Characters may direct the fire of more than one Weapon Component (either macro-batteries or lances). This means that one character may direct all of a ship's weapons fire, although different Weapon Components may be fired by different characters if the party chooses. A ship's weapons may be directed against multiple targets. The gunner (or gunners) may select targets for their macrobatteries in turn, unless they are combining the fire of several macrobatteries into a single salvo.

The range of the shot can affect its accuracy. When firing at a target further away than the range of the weapon (up to the maximum of twice the range), the shot suffers a -10 penalty to the Ballistic Skill Test. However, when firing at a target at half the range, the shot gains a +10 bonus to the Ballistic Skill Test.

When firing a weapon, if the character rolls a number of successes equal to the weapon's Crit Rating, the shot has caused a Critical Hit. If the shot does not do any damage to Hull Integrity, inflict 1 automatic point of damage. Then roll 1d5 on the Critical Hit chart and apply the result to the target.

Righteous Fury does not apply to shipboard weapons.

## Firing Arcs

Whether or not a Weapon Component may be fired at a target is determined by its firing arc: front (fore), port (left), starboard (right), and rear (aft). Firing arcs extend in a 90 degree arc from the centre of the vessel. For a visual representation of firing arcs, see Starship Facings. If there is any question between whether a target is in a ship's fore or aft arcs or in its side arcs, the target is considered to be in the side arc. What arcs a weapon my fire in are determined by the location the Weapon Component occupies on a starship: Dorsal, Prow, Port, Starboard, or Keel.

- Dorsal Weapon Components are mounted on the starship's spine or up most decks. They have a wide firing arc, but less weapons can be installed in the relatively limited space. Dorsal weapons may fire to the fore, port, and starboard.
- Prow Weapon Components are packed into the starship's forward spaces, and are often weapons that must run along much of the length of the hull. Prow weapons on transports, raiders, and frigates may fire to the fore. Prow weapons on light cruisers, cruisers, or larger vessels may fire to the fore, port, and starboard.
- Port and Starboard Weapon Components are installed in broadsides along the left and right sides of the starship, respectively. Port weapons can fire to the port firing arc, Starboard weapons to the starboard firing arc.
- Keel Weapon Components are often on long masts or fins below the starship's belly, and are rare on Imperial vessels. Keel weapons may fire in any direction.

# Types of Weapons

Macrobatteries and lances function largely the same, while torpedoes and nova cannons differ in a number of ways.

Macrobatteries form the main armament of most ships, filling the broadsides of vessels with rank upon rank of gigantic weapons. Each requires a crew of dozens, if not hundreds, to operate. Whether they fling kilo-tonne warheads across the void or roast their targets with high-intensity energy, macrobatteries fire in volley. Their salvos are designed to blanket the space around a target, hopefully catching it in a maelstrom of destruction and overwhelm their defences by the sheer number of shots.

Lances are rare and potent weapons that fire incredibly high-powered beams of energy capable of burning through the hull of a warship, or cutting a smaller vessel in half. Unlike macrobatteries, lances are often mounted on gigantic turrets where multiple energy projectors focus to create a single, titanic beam.

The most common form of torpedo is over 60 metres long and contains both a powerful warhead and a short-lived plasma reactor similar to, but less stable than, those used in starships and Titans. Each torpedo is built to accelerate quickly from its launching tube into the void, hurtling in a straight line towards the enemy. While many torpedoes are fired to deter enemy movement and thus may never strike, each individual weapon can do significant damage to a voidship, and thus are feared by many captains.

Nova Cannons are a classification of exceptionally powerful weaponry that can only be mounted upon capital ships. Mounted below the heavily armoured prows of Imperial Navy cruisers and battleships, Nova Cannons have few equals in terms of their range or destructive power.

## Macrobatteries And Lances

Each Weapon Component does not necessarily consist of one weapon-a single macrobattery, for example, can have dozens of individual macrocannons arrayed in broadside. Instead of these weapons being treated separately, they are grouped together into a single Weapon Component and treated as a single weapon that can score multiple hits when fired. Although most Weapon Components are classified as macrobatteries or lances, this simply means they follow the same general rules. Specific weapons may have different rules and unique abilities.

Each Weapon Component has the following statistics:

-   Strength: This is the maximum number of hits a macrobattery or lance can land on an enemy ship.
-   Damage: This is the Damage each hit deals.
-   Crit Rating: This is the number of successes the shot must have to score a critical hit on the target.
-   Firing Arc: This determines which direction a starship weapon may be fired in.
-   Range: This is the range of the weapon. Starship weapons may be fired at targets no farther away than twice the weapon's range.

When firing a macrobattery, a successful roll scores one hit, plus an additional hit for each degree of success, to a maximum of the macrobattery's strength. Essentially, a more accurate hit means the character was able to land more shots on the enemy ship. After the ship calculates the amount of hits it has scored, apply the effects of the defender's void shields (see "Damage and Defences" below). Once the final number of hits has been determined, roll the weapon's indicated Damage once for each hit, adding the totals together. The final total is the amount of damage dealt to the target.

If a ship fires multiple macrobatteries at a single target, before rolling to hit and the determining the damage total for each macrobattery, the character directing the firing has the option of adding the totals together and applying the new, larger total to the target ship once, rather than applying each damage result separately. This represents a ship combining its weapon fire into a single, devastating salvo. If he chooses to do this, however, he can only inflict a maximum of one Critical Hit (see below).

Lances operate in a similar fashion, but with several distinct differences. When firing a lance, a character makes a Ballistic Skill Test with any appropriate modifiers. A successful roll scores one hit, plus one additional hit for every three degrees of success.

Unlike macrobatteries, the damage from each lance hit is never combined. Each damage total is resolved against the target's defences separately. However, when resolving a lance hit against the target, ignore the target's armour (see "Damage and Defences," below), but not void shields. Lances deal damage directly to Hull Integrity.

If the damage of two or more macrobatteries is combined into a single salvo, those macrobatteries can only inflict a maximum of one Critical Hit. Even if all of the macrobatteries cause Critical Hits on their Ballistic Skill Tests, only one Critical Hit is applied to the target vessel.

Unless multiple macrobatteries are being combined in a salvo, each Weapon Component should be resolved against the target separately, not simultaneously. (This is important due to the manner in which void shields work.)

## Torpedoes 

Torpedoes differ from macrobatteries and lances in a number of ways, particularly in the manner they are fired. For the sake of clarity, the entire process of launching and attacking with torpedoes is described here and does not refer to the rules for shooting macrobatteries and lances above.

In all cases, torpedo tubes, torpedo launchers and other equivalent Components must always be mounted in either a Prow or Keel weapon location. The forces exerted upon a vessel when firing a salvo of torpedoes are such that only certain mounts can properly contain them. For this reason, on any vessel of Grand Cruiser size and smaller, torpedoes may only fire into the Fore arc, regardless of where the weapon Component is located.

Before the weapons can be fired, the launchers must be loaded. Normally, it takes a full Strategic Turn in combat to reload any empty tubes on a vessel, at which point the torpedoes may be fired in subsequent turns. However, to reload faster, an Explorer may perform the Rapid Reload Extended action.

As with macrobatteries and lances, a single torpedo launcher weapon Component actually comprises several launch tubes. This is, as with other weapon Components, denoted as the Component's Strength. All the other properties of an attack using torpedoes are determined by the torpedoes themselves, which have a number of characteristics that define them:

- Speed: The distance in VUs the torpedoes can travel in a single Strategic Turn.
- Damage: The damage each Torpedo causes on a hit.
- Critical Hit: The value needed on the damage dice in order to score a critical hit on the target.
- Range: The number of VUs the torpedoes may travel in total, before the reactor becomes dormant and the Torpedo ineffectual.

When firing torpedoes, the launcher's entire Strength value of torpedoes is launched as a single group, referred to as a Salvo. No attack roll is needed at the time of firing, but a single Explorer or NPC must be assigned to launch the Torpedoes, as his skill at readying them for launch will determine their success when they reach their target. This character may still fire other weapons during that Shooting Action as normal- the only difference is that "firing" the torpedoes does not require a test until the torpedoes reach their target.

Torpedoes are different than macrobatteries, lances, and Nova Cannons, because the weapons are largely self-contained. Due to this, Explorers cannot perform extended actions to boost the accuracy of torpedoes. No matter how quickly or competently the crew loads a torpedo, it does not affect the weapon's machine spirit's ability to hit a target. In the same way, bonuses from shipboard Components does not boost the Ballistic Skill Test to hit with torpedoes.

Upon firing and at the start of each of the parent ship's subsequent Strategic Turns before any other actions are performed, a Salvo travels directly forward a number of VUs equal to its Speed. The torpedoes continue to travel in this manner until they have travelled a total number of VUs equal to their Range, at which point their reactors' limited fuel is depleted and the torpedoes shut down, cold and inactive.

If, at any point during movement, a Salvo passes within 1 VU of another vessel (friend or foe; a torpedo's machine spirit is unable and unwilling to make such a distinction), then the character who launched the Torpedoes makes a Challenging (+0) Ballistic Skill+Torpedo Rating Test. On a successful test, one torpedo strikes the target ship, plus an additional torpedo for every Degree of Success. No more torpedoes may hit than the number present in the salvo. Torpedoes are not stopped or hindered by void shields.

Note, if using a grid map, torpedoes hit any target in the same grid square as they are travelling, or the grid squares on either side (effectively giving them a 3 VU coverage).

Once the total number of torpedo hits has been determined, roll the torpedoes' listed damage value once for each torpedo that hit, comparing each damage result to the target's armour. For every point that exceeds the target's armour, deal one point of damage to the target's hull integrity.

All torpedoes also have a unique rule: Terminal Penetration (X). When a torpedo rolls damage, re-roll any dice results equal to or lower than the value given in parentheses. The results of the re-roll stand, they are not re-rolled again.

Unlike macrobatteries, the damage from multiple torpedoes in a salvo is not combined then compared to starship armour.

Any torpedoes which are not shot down by turret fire and which do not hit the target vessel continue moving as normal until they either strike a vessel or reach their maximum range.

### Torpedoes and Critical Hits 

Torpedoes resolve Critical Hits differently than almost every other attack available to a vessel. This is for one very obvious reason-accuracy. While macrobatteries, lances and attack craft can all guide their attacks to various degrees, the final approach of a torpedo is largely automated and fairly clumsy by comparison. Consequently, the chance of a torpedo scoring a Critical Hit is determined by damage and random chance rather than operator skill.

When a torpedo rolls damage, if at least one of the dice values equals or exceeds the value listed in the Crit Rating of the torpedo's profile, the torpedo causes a Critical Hit. If the torpedo has not done damage to Hull Integrity, it does 1 point of damage. Then roll 1d5 on Table Critical Hits to generate the Critical Hit result.

### Short and Wide Salvos 

It is possible to launch torpedoes in smaller salvos than the number of available tubes-whether because the ship does not have enough torpedoes to load all its tubes, or because a canny captain wants to hold some in reserve, ready to fire at a moment's notice.

Launching a "short salvo" does not require any test; the Explorer directing the launch simply announces how many he is launching. However, if in subsequent turns the Explorer wishes to launch more torpedoes than remain in the tubes, he will need to reload first.

Likewise, some canny Explorers may want to launch a wider "spread" of torpedoes, saturating a wider area to make the salvo harder to evade. This decreases the chances of multiple strikes, but likewise decreases the chances of enemy ships getting out of the way. If an Explorer wants to fire a "wide salvo," he announces it on firing. These behave in the same way as normal salvos, except that the torpedoes attack any targets passing within two VUs, instead of one (effectively giving them a 5 VU coverage on a grid). However, the Ballistic Skill Test to hit becomes Hard (-20) instead of Challenging (+0), and the maximum number of hits the torpedoes can score is equal to half the salvo's current size. A ship must be able to launch at least two torpedoes to fire a wide salvo.

### Torpedoes Ammunition

Unlike ammunition for personal firearms, every ship has a finite supply of torpedoes. Each Torpedo Tube Component lists how many torpedoes it is able to hold. Once that number of torpedoes has been fired, the ship may not fire more torpedoes until more have been procured. Procuring additional torpedoes requires an Acquisition Test, with all pertinent modifiers applying. Each type of torpedo has a Availability rating, and in addition, if one wishes to purchase multiple torpedoes, scale ratings apply as well. The one exception to this is Craftsmanship. Torpedoes do not have different craftsmanship. However, due to their rarity and the difficulty in producing them outside of a Forge world, all Acquisition Tests to procure torpedoes not made on a Forge world suffer a -10 modifier in addition to any other modifiers.

## Nova Cannons 

While variation exists, a typical Nova Cannon consists of an array of potent gravimetric impellers designed to accelerate a projectile to a fraction of the speed of light. These projectiles vary more than the nature of the cannons themselves, ranging from sophisticated plasma warheads which burn with the ferocity of a small star for a fraction of a second, to implosive devices which exert destructive gravitational forces upon all those caught within several thousand kilometres of the detonation. In any case, a well-used Nova Cannon is a terrifying thing to face, as much a psychological tool as a weapon. The weapons however are often ill-favoured by the Imperial Navy, with most captains preferring to utilise the more traditional torpedoes. Those few who favour the weapon understand that it is difficult to use and often rendered useless at close ranges.

### Firing the Nova Cannon 

Nova Cannons are extremely powerful weapons, easily able to wreak vast destruction upon enemy vessels at great range, but are inaccurate and require a stable vessel to fire effectively. Due to the lethal nature of their warheads, nova cannon shells are not armed for a fraction of a second after firing, allowing them to travel many tens of thousands of kilometres through the void before they become truly deadly. For these reasons and several others, nova cannons follow a number of specific rules when firing which do not apply to other weapons.

If a ship performs a Manoeuvre Action with a total modifier of greater than Challenging, it may not fire its Nova Cannon in the same turn. Similarly, a Crippled ship may not fire its nova cannon. Once a Nova Cannon has fired, its crew must spend the subsequent turn reloading and preparing the weapon for a second firing. This means a Nova Cannon may only fire once every other turn.

When firing a Nova Cannon, nominate a single point anywhere within the weapon's maximum range that is more than 6 Void Units from the ship and in the vessel's Fore firing arc. That is the target point. The difficulty of targeting with a nova cannon is such that all attack rolls with the weapon suffer an additional -20 penalty. Otherwise, the attack roll is resolved normally using a character's Ballistic Skill during a Shooting Action, including the normal modifiers for range.

A successful attack roll means that the shot was on target and detonates at the desired point. A failed attack roll means that the shot was not on target and has instead detonated too soon or too late. However, such is the power of these weapons that even an inaccurate shot may still damage the enemy. For every degree by which the attack roll failed, the target point moves 1VU away from the firing ship if the attack roll was an even number (i.e. a number ending in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8), or 1VU towards the firing ship if the attack roll was an odd number (i.e. a number ending in 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9).

In either case, any vessel within 1 VU of the target point will be hit by the shell's detonation, causing 1d5 hits (which can be negated by void shields as normal) dealing the weapon's normal damage. Damage from a Nova Cannon shell ignores armour. Any damage dice that roll a 10 cause one Critical Hit. If a Critical Hit is scored, then roll 1d5 on the Critical Hit chart and apply the results as normal. Such is the power of the Nova Cannon that it may cause multiple Critical Hits in this way, rather than a maximum of one as is the case for most weapons.

An accurate Nova Cannon shell can potentially deal far more damage. If the attack roll succeeds by two or more degrees, then a single vessel within 1 VU of the target point (chosen by the firer) suffers 1d5+2 hits instead of 1d5. As noted above, damage dice rolling natural 10s cause Critical Hits.

### Nova Cannon Ammunition 

Like torpedoes, nova cannon shells are difficult to manufacture, and unless one is serving in the Imperial Navy, even more difficult to procure. A Nova Cannon Component comes with a finite supply of warheads (default storage of 20, although different Components may store different amounts). Once those warheads are exhausted, procuring more requires an Acquisition Test, with all pertinent modifiers applying. Nova cannon shells have an availability of Extremely Rare. However, due to their rarity and the difficulty in producing them outside of a Forge world, all Acquisition Tests to procure Nova Cannon shells not made on a Forge world suffer a -10 modifier in addition to any other modifiers.
