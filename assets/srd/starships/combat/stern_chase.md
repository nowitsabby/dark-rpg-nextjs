# Stern Chase 

In some situations, a starship may prefer to flee from opponents, rather than stand and fight. Perhaps a smuggler wishes to run a naval blockade, or a privateer is chasing a valuable prize. Perhaps a ship simply wishes to flee combat, and her captain is doubtful of her chances of successfully disengaging under the enemy's guns. In such situations, players have the options of using the rules for a stern chase-a flight and pursuit between two ships that might last hours, or even days.

Stern chases may begin in combat, or outside it. If two ships are not in combat and one ship flees, the other ship may elect to pursue it, beginning a stern chase. If the ships are in combat, a ship may flee the combat if it ends its turn out of range of the guns of any enemy ships. If it does so, it must make a Routine (+10) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test (if it fails, it must remain in the combat and forfeit its next Strategic Turn). Then, all other participants in the combat have the options of pursuing the fleeing vessel. If they chose to do so, they leave the combat on their next Strategic Turn and the stern chase begins.

If the Explorers are the pursuers, the stern chase is treated in a similar manner to an Exploration Challenge, where the various Explorers will use certain Skill Tests to accumulate a number of successes that must equal a predetermined total for the chase to succeed. The total required for success is based largely off the type of ship the Explorers are pursuing.

-   Transport, Cruiser: 3 Degrees of Success
-   Light Cruiser, Frigate: 5 Degrees of Success
-   Raider: 7 Degrees of Success
-   If the pursued ship's Speed is greater than the pursuer ship's Speed: +2 Degrees of Success
-   If the pursuer ship's Speed is greater than the pursued ship's Speed: -2 Degrees of Success
-   If the pursuit takes place in asteroids, nebula, or other obscuring stellar environments: +1 Degree of Success

To obtain these, the Explorers may test the following Skills as if they were participating in an Exploration Challenge: Tech- Use, Operate (Voidship), Command, and Scrutiny (at the Game Master's discretion other Skills may apply, and the required successes may vary). As with Exploration Challenges, each Explorer may test each of these Skills once, with the default difficulty being Challenging. Success on a Skill Test will reduce the difficulty of subsequent Tests by one step. Degrees of success add an equal number of degrees of success towards successfully completing the stern chase. Conversely, failing a Skill Test makes subsequent Tests one degree more difficult, and each degree of failure removes one degree of success from the total.

If the Explorers manage to accumulate enough degrees of success to accomplish the stern chase, they bring their quarry to heel. The fleeing ship may surrender, or combat begins as the ship desperately tries to fight its pursuer (follow the rules for space combat). If they fail, their quarry escapes into the vastness of the void.

It is possible, of course, that the Explorers are the ones being pursued. In that case, the same rules are used (the Explorers must still accumulate a certain amount of successes to successfully escape from their pursuers), with several minor changes. The pursuing ship is now what sets the base number of successes, meaning the Explorers are still the ones attempting the Skill Tests. Also, if the Explorers (the ones being pursued) have a faster ship, they make the Challenge easier, and if they have a slower ship, they make the Challenge more difficult (reverse the penalties and benefits listed above). In addition, if the Explorers use celestial phenomena to their advantage, by fleeing through asteroids or nebulas, they make the Challenge one degree less difficult. If the Explorers succeed, they are the ones who escape into the vastness of space, and if they fail, they are the ones who must make the difficult choice to fight or surrender.

In either version of the stern chase, the time it takes to accomplish a stern chase roughly equals two hours per degree of success required to successfully accomplish it. This time will be spent whether or not the chase is successful.

Remember, a while a Stern Chase takes place, both ships are visible to each other, but out of range of each other's weapons.
