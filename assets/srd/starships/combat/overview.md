# Starship Combat

Space combat is a terrifying experience. Massive batteries of macro-weaponry fling shells and munitions, torpedoes the size of hab-blocks streak through the void, and ships are consumed by fi e or explode with the fury of a nova. If a void shield fails or armour plating buckles, thousands of lives can be snuffed out in an instant. However, there will come times when a Rogue Trader has little choice but to run out her guns and prepare for battle. After all, they are not the only ones who desire the galaxy's wealth, and to take it for themselves, Rogue Traders must be prepared to fight for it.

## Rounds, Turns, and Time - in Space 

Space combat is handled in a similar manner to normal combat. Space travel is normally handled in Narrative Time. Other situations, such as dodging a hurtling asteroid at the last moment, are best broken up by the GM into the standard Turns and Rounds. However, certain situations- particularly ship-to-ship combat-require a slight adjustment to the Structured Time approach.

Space warfare is very different from the close-in, personal fighting of hand-to-hand combat and short ranged firefight. Great warships can spend days chasing down their opponents and hours manoeuvring into position for single devastating volleys from their broadsides. Therefore, the GM should break up space combat into Strategic Rounds and Strategic Turns. While these function mechanically in the same fashion as the Rounds and Turns of Structured Time, the interval of time they represent is longer. A Strategic Round lasts for roughly thirty minutes, during which, each ship involved in the scene takes a Strategic Turn. Each Strategic Turn overlaps, so the actions of each ship occur almost simultaneously. However, in game terms, each ship acts in a sequence determined by the combat's Initiative Order (see below).

A Strategic Round is completed when every participant in the combat has completed their Strategic Turn.

### Space Combat Overview 

When a Round of space combat begins, the GM and players follow certain steps to determine what happens. These steps are similar to those followed when regular combat begins, and the differences are specified below. Surprise It is certainly possible for one ship to surprise another in combat. Since Strategic Rounds last a half hour, it is highly unlikely that even a surprised crew will be completely unable to react. However, the attacker may be able to land a few crippling blows as the defender's crew struggles to prepare their ship for combat. See the sidebar for the effects of surprise.

#### Initiative 

At the beginning of the combat, the captain of each ship rolls 1d10 and adds her ship's Detection bonus (the tens digit in its Detection characteristic). Bonuses that apply to a character's Initiative in Structured Time (regular combat) do not apply, otherwise Initiative in space combat works the same as regular combat.

#### Taking Turns 

Starting with the ship with the highest Initiative roll, each ship takes a Strategic Turn, during which it will make a Movement and Shooting Action. Players may take Extended Actions as well.

#### The End of the Round 

Once every ship has taken its Strategic Turn, the Strategic Round ends. Continue to play successive Rounds until the GM determines the combat is over.

### Surprise 

Surprise affects the first Strategic Round in space combat. As in regular combat, the GM must ultimately determine which vessels are Surprised, based on the actions of the players and NPCs and the environment their ships are operating in. Here are some guidelines to take into account.

-   Hidden vessels: The fury of a running plasma drive is almost impossible to hide in open space. However, a canny captain may use a convenient asteroid field, nebula, or even planet to mask her engine signatures. Alternatively, ships can go on Silent Running to lurk in the cold darkness of space while her opponents fly right to them. A proper Scrutiny+Detection Test with the ship's detection equipment may warn of the danger.
-   Ambush and treachery: In some situations, a friend may turn to foe in an instant. Such situations are highly dangerous if the ambusher is in close formation with her target. She may not even have to manoeuvre to place her target squarely within her sights. Although it is up to the GM, a skilled scanner operator may detect the last-minute powering up of the weapons with a Challenging (+0) Scrutiny+Detection Test.
-   Extenuating circumstances: Ships' scanners and detection equipment are fickle devices, and easily fooled by powerful celestial phenomena such as solar flares, magnetic storms, and unpredictable gravity fluctuations. The interference may be powerful enough to mask the approach of attackers.

Using these guidelines (and any others she deems necessary), the GM determines at the beginning of combat if anyone is Surprised. Any attackers firing on Surprised ships gain a +20 bonus to attack rolls against them during the first Round of combat.

## Actions 

During each Strategic Round, each ship receives one Strategic Turn. Like regular combat, each ship can perform Actions during this turn. The Actions a ship performs fall into two categories: Manoeuvre Actions and Shooting Actions. Each ship must make one Manoeuvre Action and may make one Shooting Action during their turn. Each of these Actions must be performed by a separate Explorer. Any Explorers who did not perform either Action may perform an Extended Action instead.

Individual characters will take their turns during their ship's Strategic Turn. They do not roll for initiative separately. At the beginning of each ship's turn, the players (or the GM, if it an NPC's ship) determine which Shooting Action, Manoeuvre Action, and Extended Actions the players will perform, and in which order. All Actions (and the order they are performed in) must be determined at the beginning of the starship's Turn.

Under normal circumstances, players must perform the ship\'s Manoeuvre Action before its Shooting Action, and may perform Extended Actions anywhere in this order that they wish (before a Manoeuvre or Shooting Action to grant it a bonus, for instance, or afterward to compensate for its consequences).

Note: Actions often require a Combined Skill Test, such as a Operate (Voidship) + Manoeuvrability Test. After all, even an ace pilot must rely to an extent on her equipment. To make these tests, add the ship's ability, such as Manoeuvrability, to the character's Skill, such as Operate (Voidship). Then perform the test using the combined value.

### NPC Actions 

It is entirely possible that the players will want to perform more actions than there are players in a group. In this case, the GM should remember that the players' characters command a ship with thousands of crewmembers. If the players want to have a crewmember perform any of the following Actions, they can. If they do so, the GM will roll to see if the Action is successful, starship\'s Crew Rating.

However, the GM should be careful not to let the players delegate too many tasks to their NPCs. In general, the GM should only allow the NPCs aboard a vessel to perform three Actions per Strategic Round. Alternatively, the GM can allow the NPCs aboard a vessel to perform a number of Actions per Strategic Round equal to the tens column of the NPC crew's Skill rating. So, for example, a Competent crew could perform three Actions, while a Veteran crew could perform five. Either option is valid, and the GM should select one to use when setting up her game.

Players should keep in mind their NPC crewmembers are rarely as skilled as they are. Also, GMs should use common sense when dealing with the delegation of tasks to NPCs, and are encouraged to require the Explorers to perform certain, more important, actions personally. The idea is to keep the players involved in a combat, and not have it come down to a series of NPC activities and dice roles.

### Manoeuvre Actions 

During space combat, opposing ships can be less than a hundred metres apart, or have many thousands of kilometres between them. The latter is far more likely-it is rare that a gunner on a ship can see her target with an unaided eye.

In space combat, the distance from one ship to another, or how far a ship moves in a Strategic Turn, is measured in void units (VUs). The distance represented by a single VU is deliberately abstract and left open to some interpretation due to space's vast size. However, a good guideline is a single VU equals roughly 10,000 kilometres. Since even a single VU represents a vast distance, it is possible for two ships to be within one VU of each other. At that range, space combat becomes truly brutal, with ramming attempts and even boarding actions.

Basic space combat begins with all ships involved at a distance from each other determined by the scenario and the GM. There may be other phenomena in the combat as well, a nearby planet, perhaps, or even a vast asteroid field.

When beginning combat, the GM and players should determine the direction each starship is facing. A starship's facing is the direction it will travel when moving directly forward.

When a starship takes its Manoeuvre Action, it chooses to move directly forward a number of VUs equal to its Speed value or half its Speed value. This is the default action of a starship- since starships are huge vessels with immense momentum, players do not have the option of simply not moving their ship. Once the starship has moved forward by its Speed value or half its Speed value, it may turn. Transports, raiders, frigates, and other ships of equivalent size (i.e., Hull Integrity and Available Space) can turn up to 90 degrees to the left or right (or port and starboard). Unless otherwise stated, all other ships may turn up to 45 degrees instead.

Either version of this Manoeuvre (moving at half or full Speed value) is considered the starship's default Manoeuvre, and does not require any Skill Tests to perform. However, a skilled pilot can use more advanced Manoeuvre Actions to modify this Manoeuvre. Each Manoeuvre modifies (but does not replace) the basic Manoeuvre action mentioned above, and only one Manoeuvre may be selected per Turn. Unless specified otherwise, a starship's turn may never be more than 90 degrees. If a starship ever fails its Test while performing a Manoeuvre, it simply makes either version of its default Manoeuvre (it moves forward either half its Speed value or its full Speed value, then may turn).

#### Silent Running 

A ship may be attempt to avoid notice by going on silent running, shutting down non-essential systems and attempting to drift, unnoticed, past its opposition. When on silent running, a ship makes Manoeuvre Actions as normal, except the starship's Speed value is halved, and the difficulty of all related Skill Tests increases by one step. The default Manoeuvre Action requires an Ordinary (+10) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test. If the helmsman fails these tests, her ship performs the Manoeuvre as normal, but some power surge or engine flare betrays their presence, and any ships within sensor range become aware of them. Enemy ships may detect a ship on silent running by using the Active Augury Extended Action. Needless to say, if the ship fires any weapons, it is immediately detected as well.

### Shooting Actions 

After completing its Manoeuvre Action, a ship has the option of firing its weapons. Each Weapon Component may be fired once per Strategic Turn, and all Weapon Components must be fired at once, although they may be fired at different targets. A Weapon Component may only be fired at a target within its firing arc. Firing weapons and resolving damage is covered later in this document.

### Extended Actions 

Extended Actions are only available to characters who have not taken part in Manoeuvre or Shooting Actions this turn. They represent characters doing other activities to aid the ship, such as making repairs, caring for the wounded, and even raiding enemy vessels. Note: The modifiers listed for Skill Tests may be modified at the GM's discretion. Although each player may only perform one Extended Action per Strategic Turn, it may or may not take the entire 30 minutes, depending on the action.

### Ramming and Boarding Actions

There are desperate times in the fury of space combat when a captain's only course of action is to use her own starship as a weapon. If a starship ends its Manoeuvre Action within one VU of an enemy vessel and its bow is facing said vessel, the starship may give up its Shooting Action this turn and ram the ship instead. The helmsman must make a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship) + Manoeuvrability Test. If she succeeds, the ship crashes into its target, doing damage based on its hull size - 1d5 for transports and raiders, 1d10 for frigates, 2d5 for light cruisers, and 2d10 for cruisers. The ship adds the die roll to its prow armour value for total damage inflicted. This damage ignores void shields. The ramming ship then takes damage equal to the defending ship's Armour plus 1d5 to their prow armour, also ignoring void shields.

However, sometimes, the best course of action is to crash into the enemy, send across parties of armsmen and ratings, and take their ship by storm. This is called a boarding action.

If a starship ends its Manoeuvre Action within 1 VU of its target, it may give up its shooting action to Board the target. The helmsman must make a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship)+ Manoeuvrability Test. If she succeeds, the two ships crash together and the boarding action begins. While two ships are involved in a boarding action, neither of them can take Manoeuvre or Shooting Actions (meaning the two ships remain stationary), although individual characters may still take Extended Actions. The ships are locked together, and the only way a ship can break free is by making a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship)+ Manoeuvrability Test at the beginning of its turn. If a ship attempts to break free and fails, however, it will suffer a -20 to the subsequent opposed Command Test (see below).

The two ships take their Strategic Turns simultaneously, dropping to last in the initiative order. During their turns, two characters, one from each ship (whoever is leading the ship's warriors), make an opposed Command Test. The ship with the larger Crew Population value will receive a +10 bonus to its character's Command Test for every full 10 points difference in Crew Population between the two ships. The ship with the higher remaining Hull Integrity provides a +10 bonus to its character's Command Test for every full 10 points difference in Crew Population between the two ships. Each ship's turret rating also provides a bonus.

For each degree the winner wins by, she may choose to inflict one of the following options on her opponent. The loser may either suffer 1d5 Crew Population and 1d5 Morale damage (representing the crew cutting through the enemy), or 1 point of Hull Integrity damage (representing the crew setting charges and doing as much damage as possible). Damage to Hull Integrity will also result in damage to Crew Population and Morale as normal.

The ship that has lost the opposed Command Test must then roll a d100 and compare it to their current Morale. If they roll an equal or lower number than their Morale, their crew continues to fight. During the next Strategic Turn, both ships will make opposed Command Tests again. If, however, the losing ship rolls higher than their current Morale, their crew routes and surrenders to their captors. If the ship is an NPC vessel, it surrenders. If it is the Explorers' vessel, the characters face a grim choice-surrender to their foes, or try and flee as best they can\...

## Destroying Ships 

Most of the Critical Hit results will not destroy a ship outright. Rather, they will instead damage it in some way. This is indicative of the nature of space combat-ships are rarely completely destroyed, and often even badly damaged hulks can be dragged back to port for salvage and refit. However, a GM should never feel constrained by the Critical Hit chart when dealing with an NPC vessel. If she prefers a simpler space combat, she can modify the Critical Hit Chart in the following manner. When the starship is reduced to zero Hull Integrity, the Critical Hit Chart changes so the 1-9 results are the enemy vessel drifting away as a shattered, completely worthless hulk, and the 10-12 results are the ship violently exploding. If a 10-12 critical result is rolled, treat the ship as if it suffered a Catastrophic Overload. This means an NPC vessel will suffer the effects of Critical Hits as normal while its Hull Integrity is above zero. Once it hits zero, any Critical Hit-whether from doing damage past Hull Integrity or from a Weapon Component's Crit Rating-will destroy the vessel. Of course, this modification means the players will have no enemy ship to board and explore\...

## Damage and Defences 

There are two principle defences for starships in the 41st millennium, void shields and armour.

Void Shields create an invisible energy barrier around a starship. Miracles of lost technology, these barriers serve two purposes. First, they brush aside swaths of dust and detritus adrift in the void that would otherwise scar, befoul, and even destroy a starship (though they offer little protection against especially large objects like asteroids). Their second purpose is to absorb the terrific energies of incoming fire. If it absorbs too much energy too quickly, however, the void shield collapses, and must bleed off the accumulated energy before it can be raised again.

Armour can take many forms, but is often layers of adamantine and ceramite many metres thick, covering the outer hull of the vessel.

### Void Shields

Void shields function by absorbing incoming hits before they can be resolved against their target. Whenever a ship chooses to fire on another ship during its turn, the target ship's void shields (assuming it has any!) will cancel a number of incoming hits equal to the strength of the shields. In other words, if a ship has one void shield, after an attacker determines the total number of hits going against the ship, that number of hits is reduced by one. It does not matter if the hits are from lances or macrobatteries.

However, void shields can be overloaded. Once they have reduced their strength in hits, they overload and shut down. Any remaining hits in that salvo will hit the target, and any further shots fired against the target by the attacking ship will also hit the target unimpeded by void shields.

If the attacker combines the damage of multiple macrobatteries against the defending ship, the attacker chooses which hits are discarded by the void shields. This represents the attacker timing her salvos to overwhelm the enemy's shields with her lighter weaponry.

It is important to note that void shields reduce hits from all ships firing on them. If one attacker fires on a ship, the ship's void shields reduce the hits as usual. Even if they overload and another attacker fires on the ship in the same Strategic Round, the void shields will be restored in time to protect against that attacker's fire as well.

### Armour

Once void shields have been taken into account, and the damage for the remaining hits is rolled and added together, it is compared to the target's Armour. The Armour value is subtracted from the damage total. If the result is zero or less, the target's Armour has successfully protected the vessel. If the result is more than zero, the target loses that many points of Hull Integrity.

### Hull Integrity

Hull Integrity can be considered similar to a ship's Wounds. It is a measure of how tough the vessel is, and how much damage it can take before being blown open. For every point of Hull Integrity a ship loses, it loses 1 Crew Population and 1 Morale as well.

### Turrets 

The hull of a starship is often covered with short-range, rapid-firing weapons. These could be rapid-cycling multi-lasers, quad-barrelled auto-cannon, or even vulcan megabolters. All are collectively referred to as turrets and are designed to shoot down torpedoes and assault craft, as well as help defend the ship in the event of a boarding action. If a starship has defence turrets, it has a turret rating.

The turret rating does not correspond to the actual number of turrets-a starship with scores of defence turrets might only have a turret rating of 1. For each point of a starship's turret rating, the ship imposes a -10 penalty on the Operate tests of any Hit and Run Attacks directed against it. Additionally, each point of a starship's turret rating adds +10 to its side's Command Test during a boarding action.

While Void Shields are a more than adequate defence against macrocannon shells and lance beams, they are useless against slower-moving attacks such as torpedo salvoes and bombers. Consequently, most vessels possess a number of small, lightweight defensive weapons, collectively known as turrets, incapable of harming a full starship but more than able to destroy enemy torpedoes and attack craft.

A ship's turrets work identically whether defending against torpedoes or attack craft. Before the attacker rolls to score hits the defending vessel may attempt a Ballistic Skill Test using the crew's Skill Rating, with a +5 bonus for every point of Turret Rating the vessel has (the ship must have a Turret rating of at least 1 to attempt this). If successful, then the turrets hit once, plus one additional hit for every two degrees of success, with each hit shooting down a single torpedo or attack craft squadron, reducing the number of torpedoes in the salvo or attack craft squadron in the wave before the attack roll is made. Torpedoes shot down are destroyed harmlessly. Attack craft shot down may have merely been disabled or driven off instead of destroyed, but, one way or another, can no longer attack.

## Crippled Ships 

When a ship reaches 0 Hull Integrity, it becomes Crippled. Apply a -10 penalty to its Manoeuvrability and Detection, and reduce its Speed to half. In addition, reduce the strength of all weapon Components by half (round up). A ship will remain Crippled (and continue to suffer these effects) until it has regained at least 1 Hull Integrity.

When a Crippled ship takes damage past its Armour, it takes a Critical Hit. Compare the value of the damage that exceeded the Armour to the Critical Hit chart. The ship suffers this Critical Hit result.

### Critical Hits 

Oftentimes, an especially lucky or well placed blow will do more than boil off armour or consign some unlucky pressmen to the void. Shells and beams may tear deep into a starship's gut, ripping out her insides, crippling her systems, and leaving her bleeding air.

The Critical Hit chart for ships should be used when a weapon's attack roll has met its Crit Rating, or when a crippled ship takes damage. Some Critical Hits require an attacker to know about Components on the target ship. The attacker can know what Components their target has in one of two ways. The first is through using Active Augury to scan the enemy vessel. The second is that if the enemy vessel uses a Component to attack or otherwise effect the attacker, the attacker obviously knows of its existence and can target it with a Critical Hit.

#### Critical Hit Chart
| Damage | Result | Effect |
|---|---|---|
| **1** | *Holed* | A lucky hit has wrenched open the ship's hull, exposing it to space. The attacker selects one Component (only choosing ones she knows of) that is not the bridge or plasma/warp drives. Emergency bulkheads slam into place to seal off the compartments, but this Component is depressurized.  |
| **2** | *Internal Damage* | The force of the hit ruptures bulkheads and smashes machinery. The attacker selects one Component (only choosing ones she knows of) that is not the bridge or plasma/warp drives. This Component is damaged.  |
| **3** | *Sensors damaged* | The ship's auspex arrays have been knocked out, leaving the vessel blind. Until the damage is repaired, all shooting tests suffer a –30 to hit, and all sensory tests to detect anything beyond the ship's immediate engagement range automatically fail. Additionally, as the arrays are located outside the hull, any repairs must be attempted in the void.  |
| **4** | *Thrusters damaged* | The ship's manoeuvring thrusters are smashed, venting randomly and leaking fuel. Roll 1d10. On a 1-7, the ship can still manoeuvre, albeit slowly. Reduce the ship's Manoeuvrability bonus by –20. On an 8–10, the thrusters are completely damaged. The ship cannot turn. This damage can be repaired.  |
| **5** | *Fire!* | Alarms scream through the hull as hungry flames oar though passageways and compartments. The blaze must be contained before it devours the entire ship! The attacker selects one Component (only choosing ones she knows of) that is not the bridge or plasma/warp drive—this Component is now on fire. The fire follows all the rules for shipboard fires.  |
| **6** | *Engines Crippled* | Something pierces the immense drive tubes in the ship's stern, bleeding plasma into the void and leaving the vessel drifting in space. Roll 1d10. on a 1-7, the plasma drives are still usable, though heavily damaged. Reduce the ship's Speed by half. On an 8–10, the drives are completely wrecked. Reduce the ship's Speed to 1. This damage can be repaired.  |
| **7** | *Surly Techsprites* | Something has jarred and shocked the ship's machine spirits, awakening their anger. Massive electrical surges knock out systems across the ship. Roll 1d10 for every Component. On a 4 or higher, the Component now counts as unpowered. Each Component must be repaired individually before it can receive power again. Morale takes 1d5 damage from the spooky atmosphere.  |
| **8** | *Decapitation* | A lucky hit strikes the ship's bridge, sending shrapnel scything across the compartment and opening it to space! All crewmembers on the bridge must make a Dodge reaction or be hit by shrapnel doing 2d10 Explosive damage. If the damage result is 12 or higher, the bridge Component is also depressurized. If the damage result is 16 or higher, the Component is damaged.  |
| **9–10** | *Hull Breach* | The hull of the ship is ripped asunder by tremendous force, opening compartments to the void and doing massive structural damage. The attacker selects 1d5 Components (only choosing ones she knows of, and not including the bridge). Roll a d10 for each on a 1-7 the Component is damaged and depressurized. On an 8–10 the Component is destroyed, and all crew inside are killed. Instead of rolling for Crew Population and Morale damage separately, the ship reduces both of its current values by half.  |
| **11** | *Catastrophic Damage* | A succession of powerful blows and explosions rip through the ship, causing horrendous damage. Roll 1d10. On a 1-7, the ship is hulked. On a 8-9, the ship's plasma drive explodes. On a 10, the ship's warp drive explodes instead (if the ship does not have a warp drive, it suffers a plasma drive explosion).  |
| **-** | *Space Hulk* | Catastrophic damage leaves the ship a drifting, smouldering wreck. Uncontrolled fires burn in some compartments, others are open to space, and the rest are choked with the dead and dying. Roll 1d10 for each Component. On a 1–2, it is miraculously untouched, but is unpowered. On a 3-7, it is depressurized and damaged. On a 9–10, it is completely destroyed, and all crew inside are killed. Reduce Crew Population to 1d10.  |
| **-** | *Plasma Drive Explosion* | The starship's plasma drive explodes in a single, cataclysmic explosion. All starships within 1d10 VUs of the stricken craft must make a Hard (–20) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test or be struck by the flaming debris of the destroyed vessel. Treat this as 1d5 macrobattery hits doing 1d10+4 damage each, that void shields and armour will protect against normally.  |
| **-** | *Warp Drive Explosion* | The starship's warp drive overloads and explodes, rending a seething hole in space, a maelstrom into the realm of chaos. Any starship within 2d10 VUs of the stricken craft must make a Hard (–20) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test or be struck by the chaos-storm, taking the equivalent of one lance strike doing 1d10 damage that void shields will not protect against. Additionally, every starship within 1d5 VUs of the stricken vessel must make a second Challenging (+0) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test, or be sucked into the rift. What happens next is up to the GM, but should be suitably horrible. Mass possessions and manifesting daemons are the norm, while the crew frantically tries to activate the Geller Field. The survival of those onboard the ship should by no means be guaranteed. |
