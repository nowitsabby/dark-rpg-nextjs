# Void Hazards

## Hazards Onboard a Starship

Quite a number of things can go wrong on a starship. Crippling blows from enemy guns can depressurize compartments, failing generators can plunge cabins into darkness, and a careless galley-steward can light entire decks ablaze. These problems have an adverse effect on the ship as well as unfortunate characters caught in them.

A ship's Component is either intact, unpowered, damaged, or destroyed. Intact Components are fully functional, damaged Component are non-functional but can be repaired, and destroyed Components are nightmare mazes of twisted metal, raging infernos, and the bodies of the crew that once occupied them. Needless to say, a damaged Component cannot be used and will not provide any bonuses to the ship until it is repaired. A destroyed Component cannot be repaired, only replaced at a forge world or stardock.

Unpowered Components have no gravity, no lights (besides emergency stablights), and any powered hatches and the like will not operate. A damaged Component is unpowered, but also contains other hazards, such as shorting electrical lines, ruptured bulkheads, and leaking pipes and air-lines. These can also create noxious vapors and, combined with failing air-purifier, mean that character in the Component without a breathing aid such as a gas mask will suffer from suffocation. Other environmental effects may exist in a damaged Component as well.

Destroyed Components are extremely hazardous, with nothing more than twisted, jagged metal shards, live electrical lines, no air, or raging fires. In game terms, the Component is considered to no longer exist, though the GM is free to invent a suitably nightmarish environment for any character who must enter the space the Component used to occupy.

Components may also have hazards present on them that may be mildly inconvenient, or are a danger to any characters exposed to them and possibly the entire ship.

### Depressurisation 

If a Component is depressurised, the air violently vents over a number of Rounds (the GM should determine a time depending on how big the hole-was it a micro-meteor or a lance strike?). Any characters attempting to exit the Component treat it as Difficult Terrain as they battle high winds within the compartment. Once all air has vented, all characters inside the Component suffer the effects of vacuum. It is assumed airtight hatches will keep depressurisation confined to a single Component.

Depressurisation deals 1d10 damage to Crew Population, and 1d5 damage to Crew Morale, but does not make the Component Damaged (although a depressurised Component may be damaged for other reasons, and vice-versa). The Component may even be used, provided the crewmembers wear void-suits. Depressurisation may be repaired by patching the hull, although the effects of vacuum on little details like the plumbing may linger for quite a while.

### Fire 

If a Component catches fire, it immediately deals 1d5 damage to Crew Population and 1d10 damage to Crew Morale (few things are as horrifying as a shipboard fire) and spreads through the entire Component (the GM should determine how long this takes, but it should be within 30 minutes or one Strategic Turn). Anyone occupying the Component is exposed to fire and suffers all of the appropriate adverse effects. If the fire is not brought under control in one Strategic Turn, it consumes the Component (it now counts as damaged), and moves on. The GM selects a new Component, and treats it as catching fire (including the Crew Population and Morale damage). The GM should randomly select the new Component from among what she determines are a set of logical options-it is more likely a fire would spread from the plasma drives to the warp engines than to the prow weaponry.

To put out a fire, a character must organise a firefighting team of crew and make a Difficult (-10) Command Test. This counts as an Extended Action and therefore may only be attempted once per Strategic Turn. However, multiple characters may organise firefighting teams and attempt to put the fire out, and only one needs succeed. Alternatively, the ship's captain can choose to vent the burning compartments into the void. If she does so, the fire is immediately extinguished. However, the burning Component now counts as depressurised. Instead of the normal damage to Crew Population and Morale, the ship suffers only 1d5 Crew Population damage (most of the Crew already fled the Component) but 2d10 Morale damage (nobody likes seeing their comrades vented into the void deliberately).

Needless to say, if every Component is consumed by fire, the ship is reduced to a burned-out hulk and counts as destroyed.

### Zero Gravity 

Few forces are more essential to the everyday lives of humanity, yet gravity is something most take for granted. Those aboard starships do not have that luxury. Humanity developed the grav-plate during the mystical Dark Age of Technology, allowing them to simulate the effects of gravity in the chambers and passageways of their starships. However, these systems are fickle. Poor maintenance or battle damage can shut grav-plates off at inopportune times, leaving crewmembers stranded and drifting in mid-air. Additionally, if someone is forced to exit a ship and step into the blackness of the void, she will leave the effects of the grav-plates behind. It is imperative that every able-bodied void-man knows how to handle himself in such situations.

Zero gravity is considered Difficult Terrain, meaning that the movement of characters is halved while in it, and if they attempt to charge or run, they must succeed with a Hard (-20) Agility Test or drift out of control (treat as falling prone). Certain factors may mitigate this-a Void Born character, for example, does not treat zero gravity as Difficult Terrain and therefore ignores the above penalties. Additionally, a character beginning a movement action in zero gravity must be adjacent to a floor, wall, ceiling, or other secure object, so she has something to push off from.

## Hazards Outside the Ship

Enemy vessels are only one hazard a starship may encounter in its travels. Asteroid fields, gravity tides, ice rings, and nebula are all potential threats to be avoided-or in some cases, exploited.

### Asteroid Field 

The shattered remains of planets or the leftover debris from stellar nurseries, asteroid fields are vast expanses of drifting rock. A successful Routine (+10) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test is required to navigate an asteroid field. Success means the ship passes through the asteroid field unharmed, but for every degree of failure errant chunks of space rock strike the ship, doing 1d5+1 damage. The damage is cumulative, so if there are four degrees of failure, the ship will take 4d5+4 damage, ignoring void shields. Any Tests using a ship's auger arrays within an asteroid field are made one step more difficult.

### Gravity Tides 

Though planet-dwellers consider gravity a universal constant, experienced voidsmen know that it can be a harsh and fickle force. In systems with multiple stars or large gas giants, gravity can behave strangely-sometimes in seeming defiance to the laws of physics. The most feared phenomena are the gravitational rip-tides found near gas giants during the conjunction of their larger moons, or at the midpoints of binary star-systems. Most avoid them, but a skilled-or insane-helmsman may try and use the flux to her advantage. It takes a Hard (-20) Scrutiny+Detection Test to spot a gravitational rip-tide on the ship's auger arrays, and a Challenging (+0) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test to avoid one. If a helmsman chooses, however, she can pilot her ship into the tide's gravity well while making a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test. Success means the helmsman has built up enough speed for her vessel to "shoot the rapids"-using the speed generated by the tide's pull to shoot out the other side at tremendous velocity. For every degree of success, the GM should subtract a day from the travel time to the starship's destination. If the helmsman fails the test-or the starship fails to spot and avoid the tide-the ship takes 1d5 damage to its Hull Integrity ignoring armour or void shields, and must make a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test to break free. If it fails it takes another 1d5 damage and must make another test. This continues until the ship escapes or is destroyed.

### Ice Rings 

The rings of gas giants are especially dangerous for ships, as they combine the aspects of an asteroid field and a nebula. To navigate them, a ship must make a Challenging (+0) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test and a Challenging (+0) Navigation (Stellar)+Detection Test. Failing the first test by two or more degrees means the ship has blundered upon a particularly large chunk of ice-it takes 3d10 damage ignoring void shields. Failing the second test means the ship is delayed by a day. Any Tests using a ship's auger arrays within an ice ring are made two steps more difficult

### Minefields 

A minefield reacts to a vessel inside its boundaries by making a Scrutiny Test with a Skill of 40 with a +10 modifier for every full 20 Space the vessel has (the larger the ship, the more mines it activates). The mines suffer a -40 to the Test if the vessel is on Silent Running. If the mines detect a vessel, they strike it with 1d5+2 explosive hits, with this test being done each round the vessel is in the field. Each hit deals 1d10+2 damage, and the hits are combined as though from a macrobattery salvo. Armour and void shields protects against mines as normal.

Mines are too small to be located via normal Detection; an Active Augury Extended Action reveals any minefields in within 10 VUs but immediately causes 1d5 detonations if the vessel is already within a field.

Ships can attempt to navigate a minefield in the same manner as for an asteroid field, with a Hard (-10) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test instead of a Routine Test and each impact dealing 1d10+2 damage.

Mines can also be detonated remotely with a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test if the activating ship is no more than 10 VUs distant. This instantly causes all mines to explode, causing 1d10 hits to any vessel within 1 VU of the minefield and emptying the field, but revealing the activating vessel even if the test fails. If the Minelayer Bay contains unused mines and is Damaged, there is a 50% chance the bay is Destroyed. The vessel takes one Critical Hit; roll 1d10 to determine the result.

### Nebulae 

A nebula is a vast, dense cloud of gas and dust drifting in space. A successful Difficult (-10) Navigation (Stellar)+Detection Test is required to pass through a nebula on a proper course. Success means the ship makes its way through the nebula quickly, but failure means the ship is delayed. For every degree of failure, the ship must spend an extra day getting to its destination. In addition, the maximum weapon range for ships in a nebula is limited by the nebula's density (roll 3d10 at the start of battle, this is the furthest that all ship's sensors and weapons will operate). A ship making a Silent Running Manoeuvre gains +30 to its Manoeuvre Tests. Any Tests using a ship's auger arrays within nebula are made three steps more difficult
