The profits gained by this enterprise are closely matched to the costs of running the vessel, however the Explorers can use it to augment their own endeavours. The refining process simply requires a large supply of low-grade ore, however the plasma harvesting process is more involved. The ship must enter a retrograde orbit around a blue-giant star, a manoeuvre that takes three days and requires two Ordinary (+10) Operate (Voidship) + Manoeuvrability Tests. Failure of either of these Tests by five degrees or more results in the ship's destruction. Success means the ship gains enough additional plasma to convert one full load of ore, granting the Explorers +100 Achievement Points to an ongoing Endeavour (the refined plasma can either be used in the Endeavour, or sold to generate funds)."
