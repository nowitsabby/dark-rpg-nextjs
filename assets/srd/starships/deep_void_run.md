# The Deep Void Run 

Though the Imperium of Man claims that vast swaths of the galaxy are subservient to the Golden Throne of Terra, it would be more accurate to describe mankind's dominion as tiny islands adrift in an enormous ocean. The space between stars is so huge that any claim of control is laughable, and so the majority of the Imperium remains safe, huddled around the fires of their stars. However, it is through these uncharted depths that mankind's ships must travel. Even with the help of warp drives-and the immaterium is a fickle ally at best-travel between star systems can take as long as months, or even years. Beyond the bounds of the Imperium, where the fires of civilisation are even farther apart, the journeys could even take decades.

Generally, a starship stocks at least six month's food and supplies in its lockers-although some vessels may cram an extra month's supplies on board if they anticipate a long journey. These stores can be stretched to last longer, although at a cost to the crew. As rations dwindle, fresh water grows scarce, and even the very air becomes thick and stale, sickness spreads easily and the tempers of the crew flare.

The consequences of long journeys are varying, and the GM is encouraged to invent hardships appropriate to the situation. Generally, for each month spent beyond the six month limit, the ship loses 2 Morale, and should suffer a misfortune such as the ones listed below:

## Shipboard Sickness

The stale air and water ensure the easy spread of disease. A successful Medicae Test (difficulty at the GM's discretion) can contain sickness; otherwise the ship will suffer 1d5 damage to Crew Population and Morale as it runs its course.

## Scurvy

Scarce food makes for poor nutrition. Little can be done about the lack of proper nutrients, and the loss of some of the weaker and sicker members of the crew will do 1d5 damage to Crew Population.

## Weary Machine Spirit

Long voyages strain the systems of a starship, sometimes to the breaking point. Without a full shipyard, repairs are often temporary. The GM should select a Component. For every month the ship spends at space without visiting a shipyard or civilised planet for proper repairs, a character must make a Tech-Use Test or the Component becomes damaged. These tests should become progressively harder.

## Starvation

Few things are as worrying as a starship's food stores running low, both because of the threat of starvation and because it is likely to make the crew desperate and rebellious. Starvation is not something that should happen unless a ship has been at space for longer than a year or had its food stores drastically reduced for some reason. Once it begins, however, the ship will suffer 1 damage to Crew Population and 2 to Morale every day it does not find a habitable planet or other means to refill its food stores.

Of course, the threat of mutiny is also present when crews are confined within iron bulkheads without the warm sun or fresh air for months or years on end. This is represented by the Morale loss a ship suffers, but the GM should feel free to expand on this, inventing mutinous low-decks plots or even treacherous mid-rank officers scheming to take the starship away from the characters.
