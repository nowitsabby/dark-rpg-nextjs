## Anatomy of a Starship 

In the 41st Millennium, a spacefaring vessel is rare and precious. Ships take decades, even centuries to build, if the builders have the required skills and knowledge base in the first place. It is rare to find a "new" starship-most are hundreds or thousands of years old, and some date back to the earliest days of the Imperium. Therefore, ships are never mass-produced, and even two ships of the same class are rarely alike. A Lunar-class cruiser produced in the shipyards of Mars will be vastly different from another Lunar hailing from to docks of Port Wrath.

However, regardless of class or configuration, all ships share certain components and design similarities. All starships, for example, require plasma drives to propel them through space, armour and void shields to protect them, and a hull to contain these systems. In Rogue Trader, ships have Components, the various parts that make up the starship. Some of these are vital, such as the life support system and genatoria facilities. Without them the ship will not function. Others, such as weapons batteries or luxury passenger quarters, are useful but not essential.

A ship's components, in turn, affect the ship's Characteristics. These Characteristics are similar to the Characteristics of a Rogue Trader Player Character. They represent the various abilities of a ship.

### Characteristics 

#### Speed

Speed measures how fast a ship can move in realspace.

#### Manoeuvrability

Manoeuvrability measures how quickly a ship can change direction, avoid obstacles, and evade incoming fire.

#### Detection

Detection measures the power of a vessel's auspexes and augers, and how well they can 'see' their surroundings.

#### Void Shields

Void Shields create an insubstantial energy barrier around a ship to protect it from enemy attacks.

#### Armour

Armour protects a ship from incoming weapons fire, as well as collisions from celestial dust, rocks, and other detritus.

#### Hull Integrity

Hull Integrity is a measure of how reinforced a ship's interior is, and how much damage a ship can take before breaking up. Isolated compartments, reinforced bulkheads, and blast doors increase Hull Integrity, while long, open passageways and substandard materials decrease it.

#### Power Generation

Power Generation measures the energy the ship generates to run its myriad Components. If a Component is unpowered, it will not function.

#### Space

Space measures the room in the ship for various Components. If there is not enough Space for a Component, it cannot be contained within the ship's hull.

#### Turret Rating

A starship's turret rating is an abstract representation of how many defensive turrets it has. Turrets are small, short-ranged weapons used for shooting down small attack craft and torpedoes.

#### Weapon Capacity

These are locations on a starship that have enough room to house the massive main weaponry of starships in the 41st Millennium.

#### SP

This is how many Ship Points the hull, component, or upgrade costs.

## Representing and Generating Characteristics 

Like a character's Characteristics, a ship's Characteristics are represented using numbers. However, unlike a character, a ship's Characteristics are not rated on a scale of 1 to 100. This is because, unlike a character, a ship is an inanimate object. The best ship in the Imperium is useless without an equally competent crew to operate it. Therefore, most of a ship's Characteristics are treated as static numbers to be tested against-similar to a character's Wounds or a piece of armour's AP value.

Other Characteristics, notably Manoeuvrability and Detection, are bonuses or penalties that may be added when a character on board the ship makes an appropriate Skill Test. These represent the concept that some ships are more manoeuvrable or have better augers than others, and a skilled operator is able to get more out of them.

A ship's baseline Characteristics are determined by its hull type. Some hulls, such as a transport, are roomier and able to hold more. Other hulls, such as the raider, are designed for speed and manoeuvrability, but are cramped and relatively fragile.

These baseline Characteristics can be modified depending on the Components within the ship's hull. Components can provide benefits and drawbacks. For example, larger plasma drives may make a ship faster and provide more power, but they will also take up space which could have been given over to other Components. On the other hand, reinforced adamantine armour plating can increase the ship's Armour, but its Speed and Manoeuvrability might suffer from the increased mass.

## Crew Population and Morale 

The health and well-being of a starship's crew is measured in two ways - its Crew Population and its Morale. Crew Population measures how many people are aboard a starship, indicated by a percentage of 100. Therefore, if a Crew Population was 98, that means 98 percent of the ship's original crew complement is still alive. All ships' Crew Populations begin at 100, though they may be modified by situations or the ship's Components. Morale is also measured on a 1 to 100 scale, starting at 100 and dropping as the starship encounters situations that test its crew's loyalty and commitment. With both Morale and Crew Population, higher values are better. As both values drop, they affect their starship adversely (see Starship Reference) The effects of Crew Population loss and Morale are unavoidable, but the effects are reversible if the Crew Population or Morale are later brought above the threshold. All effects are cumulative, even Crew Population and Morale effects. The effects of Crew Population loss represent the ship becoming harder to operate as there are fewer hands to crew it, while the effects of Morale loss represent the crew actively malingering or doing other activities to hamper the ship's operations.

### Mutiny

In addition, whenever Morale drops below 70, 40, and 10, the Captain must make a Command Test. If she fails, some portion of her crew rebels against her rule and a mutiny begins. Note: If the ship is in combat when Morale drops below a threshold, wait until after the combat ends to test for a mutiny. If it drops below multiple thresholds during a single combat, only test once. To represent the mutiny, the GM should choose one NPC crewmember to lead the mutiny (or invent basic stats for a general crewmember). The mutiny can be fought or suppressed through opposed Command, Charm, or Intimidation Tests, chosen by the players. One character (who does not have to be the captain) should be chosen to suppress the mutiny and make the selected opposed Skill Test.

-   If the characters chose to use Command, they are leading armsmen to suppress riots, posting guards at critical spaces, and generally waging war against the mutineers directly. If the characters win the opposed Skill Test, the ship suffers 1d5 Crew Population damage and 1d5 Morale damage, but the mutiny ends.
-   If the characters use Charm, they are meeting with the mutiny's ringleaders, addressing their demands, and trying to placate them. If the characters win the opposed Skill Test, the ship suffers 1d10 Morale damage (the characters are viewed by the crew as weak), but the mutiny ends.
-   If the characters use Intimidate, they are threatening to open crew quarters into space, shooting ringleaders, holding hostages, and generally showing the crew the dire consequences of their actions. If the characters win the opposed Skill Test, the ship suffers 1 Crew Population damage and 1d10 Morale damage (the crew fears and mistrusts their ruthless commanders), but the mutiny ends.

If the mutineers win any of these tests, another opposed Skill Test is performed. If the mutineers win again, the cycle continues. If, however, the mutineers ever win one of these tests by three or more degrees of success, the mutiny succeeds. The characters lose control of their ship, and will likely be forced to flee quickly lest they be killed by their former crew.

### Replenishing Morale and Crew Population 

Restoring a ship's Morale is often surprisingly simple. The low-decks dregs that make up the majority of a starship crew are an easily satisfied lot, often content with life's simple pleasures-or the promise of Thrones in their pocket.

If the starship is currently involved in attempting to complete an Endeavour, the captain can bribe the crew with gelt (or the promise of gelt). At any point during a shipboard journey, the ship's captain - or another authority figure - can attempt to restore Morale by losing 50 Achievement Points (from those going towards her current Endeavour) and making a Routine (+20) Charm Test. Success means she has quieted the crew's concerns (or distracted them with their greed). Frigates, transports, and raiders regain 1d10 Morale, while light cruisers and cruisers (being larger) regain 1d5. The captain may do this as many times as she wishes, however the difficulty of the test should increase by one degree each time she does. After all, Thrones are only so good when you have no place to spend them.

A captain or another authority figure can also make a Difficult (-10) Charm or Intimidate Test to rally the crew, regaining 2 Morale for every degree of success. This will only work once per game session, however.

Of course, the best way to restore a crew's Morale is to put into port. If a starship reaches a habitable planet with no traces of civilisation, the ship can spend three weeks at orbital anchor, replenishing supplies and allowing the crew to travel to the surface. This will restore a ship's Morale to maximum. If the planet (or asteroid settlement) is inhabited by a human civilisation, this process will only take two weeks. If the captain is willing to spend some gelt, (making a Routine (+20) Acquisition Test to represent money distributed and reimbursements for damage caused to local drinking dens and brothels), she can restore her ship's Morale in a single week, and completely restock her supplies as well.

Restoring Crew Population can only occur at a planet inhabited by humans. The captain can make an Acquisition Test to restore her Crew Population to maximum, hiring on new crew members from among the locals. The availability of the crew should be considered Common (+20), though this can depend on the world. A hive world may have a large enough population that crew are considered Abundant (+50), while an isolated outpost may put a premium on manpower (Scarce or even Rare). The GM can choose to add bonuses or penalties due to the scale and quality (craftsmanship) of the crew being hired as well. Failure, of course, means the Explorers must look elsewhere for their crew.

However, if she prefers, she can send teams of press-gangs into the planet's less savoury locales (be they slave camps, slums, or the underhive) to 'recruit' new crew members. If she does this, a character who is skilled in subterfuge and has contacts with the criminal underworld must make arrangements if the press-gangs are to be successful. The details are up to the GM, but at the very least a Common Lore (Underworld) Test will be required to find the right contacts, and a Commerce Test must be made to secure the deal. Failure could mean that other criminal elements take violent exception to the rogue trader's plans, the local magistratum might step in to arrest all of the characters, or the planet's general population might violently rise up against the Rogue Trader and her party. The benefits, of course, are paying a few press-gang crews will not cut into a Rogue Trader's finances.

A third option is to strike a deal with planetary authorities that will allow the rogue trader to empty their prisons to serve as her crew. If she does this, she restores her Crew Population without cost. However, she immediately loses 1d10+10 points of Morale-which cannot be restored while she remains at this planet.

No attempts to restore a starship's Crew Population or Morale can increase these values above the starship's maximum Crew Population or Morale values. Any Acquisition Tests made to restore Crew Population or Morale do not count against the number of Acquisitions an Explorer may make in a game session.

## Extended Repairs 

To survive amongst the deep void, starships must be largely self-sufficient. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the case of repairs and maintenance. Any true void-faring vessel has bunkers full of fuel and storage holds with additional supplies and ship components, from delicate cogitator circuitry to massive adamantine plates to weld over hull breaches. Though the supplies are seldom enough to completely repair a starship (especially if it has just come through a truly nasty engagement), they are enough to let the crew patch up the worst of their ship's injuries.

To perform extended repairs, a starship should locate a suitable anchorage, perhaps high orbit around a gas giant in a deserted star system or nestled against a large asteroid to avoid detection. It's crew will then spend several weeks on the repairs, determined beforehand by the ship's captain. For each week at repairs, the member of the crew directing them must make a Repair test (using an Essential Repair Skill), tallying the degrees of failure and success. If the degrees of failure outnumber the degrees of success at the end of the specified time period, the repairs have failed. If the reverse is true, however, the repairs succeed, and the ship regains 1d5 points of Hull Integrity. This cannot take the ship's Hull Integrity above its maximum. In addition, a successful repair attempt restores all damaged, depressurised, and unpowered Components to full working order. Destroyed Components must be repurchased and replaced.

For a more thorough repair job, the starship will need to find an inhabited planet or space station - preferably a world with a reasonably advanced level of civilisation (cavemen or feudal peasants will not be much help in repairing a starship). Once a suitable world has been located, the crew can pay to have their starship repaired. If any Hull Integrity is repaired, any damaged, depressurised, and unpowered Components are restored to working order a well.

For every full five points of Hull Integrity restored, the Explorers must make an Acquisition Test at a -10 penalty (this takes into account the rarity and quantity of materials and supplies). These tests are made sequentially - once one is failed, the Explorers have temporarily exhausted their available funds and must either wait 1d5 weeks until more money is available or seek repairs elsewhere (preferably where there is a better deal). Any Acquisition Tests made to repair Hull Integrity do not count against the number of Acquisitions an Explorer may make in a game session.

For every point in Hull Integrity restored, the ship must spend one day being repaired. New Components (whether to upgrade existing Components or replace destroyed Components) are purchased as normal, and require 1d5 additional days to install per Component.

## Space Travel

Outside of combat, space travel should be treated abstractly. The distances between a planet and one of its moons can be farther than a man in a land-crawler can drive in a year - the distance between two planets (or two stars) can be orders of magnitude further. An Imperial starship can generally travel the distance between a planet such as Holy Terra and its moon in little more than an hour, while that same starship could take two weeks to travel between the same planet and its star. In general, it shouldn't take much longer than that to get from one location in a star system to another; however, faster starships should take less time, while mass conveyors and other bulk transports may take far longer. In the end, travel times should be left up to the GM.
