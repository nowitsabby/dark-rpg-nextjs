# Navigating the Warp 

The primary role of all Navigators is guiding ships into, through, and out of the warp. Whilst the rest of the ship's crew and the ship's captain maintain the systems of the ship, keeping the vessel's plasma and warp drives functioning and its Gellar Field strong, the Navigator carefully studies the currents and fluctuations of the warp as well as the distance and strength of the Astronomican. Using this information, she tells the captain to make course corrections and when it is wise to leave or enter the warp. The actual Translation-as entering and exiting the warp is known-from real space to warp space or vice versa is relatively simple and does not require the skill of a Navigator, though her input can be invaluable lest the vessel find itself immediately assailed by an empyreal storm, warp rift, or worse. Once the vessel is in the warp, however, not having a Navigator would leave a captain with no idea as to the vessel's position relative to real space, the distance they have travelled, or where they will end up when the ship exits the warp except crude guesswork based on existing warp charts. The Fundamentals of Warp Navigation Navigating the warp in game terms consists of a number of stages at which the Navigator must test to perceive the nature of the warp and then steer a course through it. These stages are:

-   Stage One: Determining Duration of Passage
-   Stage Two: Locating of the Astronomican
-   Stage Three: Charting the Course
-   Stage Four: Steering the Vessel
-   Stage Five: Leaving the Warp

Each of these stages and the tests requires are detailed below.

## Stage One: Determining Duration of Passage 

The duration of a voyage is measured in subjective time; time as experienced by the Navigator and the crew of the vessel in days and hours of "untroubled passage." This calculation assumes that the vessel is following a favourable warp current and operating under good conditions. If all goes well the voyage will pass in this time. The base time of a voyage through the warp is determined by the Game Master and then modified by how well the Navigator steers the course of her craft. The figure is selected by the Games Master and kept secret from the Navigator and other players, though a Navigator may attempt to estimate the duration of passage based on what she knows of the course she must steer (see below); she might be right or she may be wildly incorrect based upon actual conditions in the warp when the passage is attempted. The duration of passage set by the GM is used as the base value for all of the subsequent stages of travel.

### The Navigator's Estimate 

A Navigator preparing a passage she is familiar with, or for which she has good navigational information, (such as a chart or navigational cipher), will have a good sense of how long it should take to arrive at her destination. In order to determine this, the Navigator can make a **Navigation (Warp) Test** (although what modifiers for difficulty apply and whether this is passed or failed should be kept secret by the GM). If she passes, the GM should give her a roughly accurate estimate of how long the voyage should take under the expected conditions. If she fails, then her estimate will be inaccurate, although just how much it is off by is up to the GM to determine, based on how badly the test was failed.

### Going into the Unknown 

It is quite possible that a Navigator must plot a course to a location with which she is not familiar, in which case she may have no real idea of easy it will be to reach or how long it will take. In these circumstances, the GM should not give the Navigator an estimation of how long the journey may take beyond the roughest "educated guess."

### Example Durations of Passage
| Passage Within the Warp | Example Voyage  |
|---|---|
| **1 day** | Short passage between two close systems by a well-travelled stable warp route.  |
| **5-10 days** | A journey between systems in the same sub-sector using accurate navigational information.  |
| **30-60 days** | A journey across the body of a full Imperial sector (such as Calixis) using accurate information and known warp routes.  |
| **100+ Days** | A perilous journey across a Segmentum at best speed avoiding only the worst known hazards.  |
| **Several Years** | An odyssey across the galaxy. |

### The Passage of Time in Real Space 

The subjective time experienced by those travelling through the warp is different from that that passes in the physical world. The amount by which time experienced within the warp and real space varies is not fixed, but if it is necessary to calculate how much time has passed in the real world whilst a ship was in the warp, use a ratio of one day of passage in the "open warp" to 12 days passing in real space on average. The Game Master should, however, feel free to vary this ratio as she sees fit and on the most stable warp routes this should be less (even in 1 to 1 parity in some places), and in turbulent areas potentially much worse. Factual accounts of ships arriving at their destination centuries late are thankfully extremely rare, but known (and should never "randomly" occur during the game). There have even been accounts of ships that have actually arrived at their destination before they have left!

## Stage Two: Location of the Astronomican

When a vessel Translates into the warp, a Navigator must gauge the strength of the Astronomican, to judge just how far and in what direction she is from Terra so that she may then plot a course. To do this, she makes an **Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test**. For every degree of success achieved, add **+10 to any Navigation (Warp) skill tests for this voyage, whilst for every degree of failure a -10 modifier is imposed instead**. If the test is failed by three or more degrees of failure, the Astronomican cannot be located-the Halo Stars are notorious for difficulties in finding the beacon's signal. In some rare cases, the Astronomican cannot be found- especially turbulent warp storms and other unnatural phenomena may obscure its signal, or the Navigator's vessel may simply have travelled beyond the Astronomican's reach. **If the Navigator cannot locate the beacon of the Astronomican, she must pass a Hellish (-60) Navigation (Warp) Test in order to chart a successful course.** Without the Astronomican, the Navigator must rely upon her own experience, skill, and ancient charts of real- and warpspace (some especially accurate charts may, at the GM's discretion, grant a bonus to this Test). If she fails the Test, the Navigator may not try again unless at the GM's discretion, or if a transient event (such as a warpstorm) ends.

## Stage Three: Charting the Course

Once the Navigator has a point of reference, she must then use her extraordinary perceptions to determine any turbulence, strange phenomena, or storms laying in wait in the Empyrean that will affect the passage of the vessel as it travels. This is accomplished by an **Ordinary (+10) Navigation (Warp) Test, whose results are kept secret by the GM**. Success means that if there is any significant warp disturbance along the route then the Navigator has likely detected it, failure means that she has not. In either case, should the Navigator fail this roll, she will be ignorant of any dangers that lay ahead. The effects of this test will influence the chance of avoiding serious warp encounters (see Table Warp Travel Encounters) during the voyage.

## Stage Four: Steering the Vessel

With the Astronomican located and the local state of the warp gauged, the Navigator now makes her Navigation roll to determine both the accuracy of her voyage and travel time. This is a **Navigation (Warp) Skill Test** modified by the Navigator's perception of the Astronomican (see Stage Two) and the general difficulty of the passage. Refer to the Navigation Chart to see the results of this test.

### Difficulty of Passage 

The Game Master should choose a duration of passage based on how difficult the voyage is and how far away the intended destination. Travel through "open warp" where no unusual phenomena or turbulence occur should be a Routine (+20) Navigation test. If the Navigator is using an established warp route or corridor, or has detailed information such as the secret charts found in a Navis Prima, the test should be considered Easy (+30). Where passages are attempted into the unknown, or where general conditions in the warp are known to adverse (prone to storms, etc.), tests should be Difficult (-10) or worse. Alternatively, if the route is very well established and the Navigator has previously travelled it many times, the GM may decide that the Navigator need not make a roll at all nor test for Warp Travel Encounters.


### Navigation Chart

| Degrees of Success / Failure | Result  |
|---|---|
| **3+ Degrees of Success** | Destination reached in a quarter of the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |
| **2 Degrees of Success** | Destination reached in half of the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |
| **1 Degree of Success** | Destination reached in three quarters of the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |
| **Success** | Destination reached in the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |
| **Failure** | Destination reached in twice the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |
| **1 Degrees of Failure** | Destination reached in three times the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |
| **2+ Degrees of Failure** | Destination reached in four times the duration set by the GM in Step 1 |

### Off Course

If a Navigator fails her Navigation (Warp) test and rolls a 9 on either dice, she is thrown off course, the vessel will appear in the wrong system or part of space (as determined by the GM).

### Encounters in the Warp

Warp travel is seldom a routine and dull affair, and the Navigator must maintain constant vigilance lest the vessel become lost or imperiled. This peril increases the longer the vessel spends in the warp and the further it travels. To reflect the perils of warp travel, the Navigator should make a roll on Table Warp Travel Encounters once for every five full days of travel within the warp. If a journey takes under five days to complete, one roll on the Warp Travel Encounters table is still made. Each of the rolls for warp encounters gains a +20 bonus if the Navigator succeeded in the Navigation test whilst Assessing Warp Conditions in Stage Three.

#### Warp Travel Encounters
| Roll | Event | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **01-03** | *Reality Erosion* | The very fabric of the vessel is altered in some way. Walls might melt, statues and picture come to life or gravity itself may become twisted.  |
| **04-09** | *Plague of Madness* | A general madness infects the crew, and without swift action bedlam can ensure. It will target the weakest of will first, but can be spread by contact.  |
| **10-18** | *Incursion* | A daemonic entity slips aboard the vessel and sets out to wreak havoc. Particularly insidious warp creatures can hide on a ship for years masking their actions as bad luck and careless accidents.  |
| **19-26** | *Lost Time* | Time contracts and expands during the voyage, and though it may take but a few days, the crew will feel as if months or more has passed, fraying their sanity.  |
| **27-33** | *Ghost Ships* | The ship's sensors detect phantom ships that appear and vanish randomly. Wise captains ignore such things, though if they are real, a vessel lost in the warp can still hold valuable cargo.  |
| **34-39** | *Shoals and Reefs* | The vessel runs afoul of a warp shoal or reef that threatens to break it open on a jagged fragment of false reality. A good helmsman and skilled Navigator are required to pass unscathed.  |
| **40-48** | *Visitations* | One or more of the crew find themselves visited by warp shades of lost friends or family. These lost souls might offer helpful advice and comfort or have darker motives.  |
| **49-53** | *Gellar Field Fluctuations* | Alarmingly, the Gellar Field that keeps back the baleful energies of the warp begins to fluctuate. Hasty prayers to the Machine God or a return to realspace may be required.  |
| **54-67** | *Warp Storm* | A terrible warp storm strikes the vessel and may cause damage or throw it off course. Only the skills of the ship's Navigator will decide the outcome.  |
| **68-75** | *Whispers and Dreams* | Everyone on board suffers from strange dreams and even hears hushed whispers when awake. These might hold hidden truths or portents should the GM wish, or merely be mad ramblings form beyond.  |
| **76-100** | *All's Well* | A safe journey that wise captains will savour. |

### Gellar Field Failures in Game 

How to represent a Geller Field failure is left up to the GM's imagination, but it should an utterly horrifying experience for players. They must quickly restore the Geller Field if they hope to survive, and even if they accomplish this, they will still be faced with a ship full of monstrous entities. The GM should feel free to pit them against all manner of daemonic adversaries, in any monstrous and terrible forms she chooses. Even if the players triumph, damage to their ship's Morale should be severe, and depending on the severity of the failure, there could be severe damage to Crew Population as well. If the battles were particularly ferocious, certain ship Components could be damaged, depressurized, or even in flames. For the players, killing the daemons may be just the beginning...

## Stage Five: Leaving the Warp

Once the Navigator\'s destination has been reached, she must make a **Hard (-20) Navigation (Warp)** Test to determine the accuracy of her entrance point in real space, which in general terms the Navigator can perceive from the warp in a shadowy and indistinct fashion. Succeeding at this test means that the vessel exits the warp were the Navigator intended. A failure means that the ship exits off target (dangerously close to a planetary body rather than in the outer reaches of a system for example), with degrees of failure indicating a more extreme deviation.
