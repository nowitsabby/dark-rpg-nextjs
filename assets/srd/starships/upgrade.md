# Upgrading and Installing New Components in Starships

An important aspect of owning a starship is improving and modifying it to suit the needs of its crew. This is done by retrofitting the vessel, a long, labour intensive, and time consuming process that often requires a full space-dock or forge world star-yard. It is also likely to be expensive, but can all pay off when marauding space-pirates feel the wrath of a freighter's concealed macro-cannons.

When installing or upgrading Components in a starship, the two Characteristics to keep in mind are Space and Power. Each Component requires a certain amount of both, and if a ship is unable to meet those requirements, the new Component will end up unpowered or exposed.

The two exceptions to this are a ship's plasma drives and hull. Plasma drives are not only the engines that move a ship through the void, they also generate power for the entire ship. Therefore, plasma drives don't have a power requirement. Instead, they provide the ship's power rating—how much power is available for the rest of the ship's Components.

Hulls are treated the same way in regards to space. Hulls define the class of vessel, and, of course, have a finite amount of space inside them. Therefore, hulls provide the amount of available space a ship has.

The cost of new Components is discussed below. The time it takes to install new Components on a starship varies depending on the facilities available. Usually, a human world with at least interplanetary space travel is required to install new Components. Such a world could install a new Component on a starship in roughly three weeks. However, a populous Imperial hive world with competent stardock could do the same task in half the time.

# Acquisition of Starship Components 

Few things acquired or maintained by the Explorers' dynasty compare to the astronomical value of their void-ships. When the Explorers wish to acquire new components for their vessel, or commandeer a new vessel, the GM should work out the Acquisition Modifier using the Component's final SP cost, after any modifiers for Craftmanship, as detailed below. However, in place of the Scale Acquisition Modifier, she should use the modifiers detailed in *Table: Starship Component Acquisitions* based on the kind of system being acquired.

## Starship Component Acquisitions

| Component | Modifier |
|---|---|
| War (macrobatteries, lances, torpedoes) | –30  |
| Etheric (auspex, vox-networks, communications) | –20  |
| Power (warp drive, generatorium, void shields) | –10  |
| Structure/Other (holds, observatories, armour, special structures, etc.) | +0 |

### Examples

Lord-captain Brevarn of the Armsmaiden wishes to refit the great fore macrocannons Primus and Secondus - upgrading them from Common Craftsmanship (1 SP) to Good (2 SP). This increases their rarity from Scarce (-10) to Rare (-20), for a total difference of -10. As a War component, an additional modifier of -30 is added, giving a final Acquisition Modifier of -40. 

The Rogue Trader Jessica Cayde wants to reinforce the prow of her vessel, the Arrayed Claws. The Arrayed Claws is a Raider-class void ship, so a Reinforced Prow has a cost of 1 SP, which gives it an Availability of Scarce (-10). As a Structure component, no additional modifier is added, giving a final Acquisition Modifier of -10. 

## Ship Points 

Ship Points have one other role to play — they determine how rare (and thus how expensive) Components are in Rogue Trader. The chart below lists the Components' availability based on how many Ship Points they cost. However, when determining the Acquisition Threshold required to acquire starship Components, the GM should never give the players a bonus based on Scale — the Threshold should only be determined by availability (and perhaps craftsmanship).

## Component Availability

| Components | Availability |
|---|---|
| Supplemental Components costing 1 SP, Essential Components | Scarce (-10)
| Supplemental Components costing 2 SP, Essential Components costing +1 SP | Rare (-20)
| Supplemental Components costing 3 SP, Essential Components costing +2 SP | Very Rare (-30)
| Supplemental Components costing 4 SP, Essential Components costing +3 SP | Extremely Rare (-40)
| Supplemental Components costing 5 SP, Essential Components costing +4 SP | Near Unique (-50)
| Supplemental Components costing 6 SP, Essential Components costing +5 SP | Unique (-60)
| Archeotech Components | Extremely Rare (-40)
| Xenotech Components | Near Unique (-50)

# Component Craftsmanship and Facilities

Even in the lawless depths of the Expanse, there are fairly well known expectations when making purchases for a vessel. Every Trader worth their warrant knows how much deck space a standard Mark VI Mars-pattern macrocannon emplacement needs, or how much power Stygies pattern torpedo tubes draw in combat. The more skillful Traders know that there are shades of quality to their acquisitions, and depending on the circumstances those acquisitions may differ from that standard.

The most common difference is simply due to lack of availability or funds. Not all worlds have the required goods at
the quality desired—and of course, if the gelt is running low, then one must make due with what's affordable. This holds true when buying a lasgun charge pack or a Titanforge Lance. Alternatively, should Explorers find themselves with a surplus of wealth, they may look to improve the quality of their shipboard Components. Replacing an ordinary Jovian Plasma Drive with one finely tuned and personally blessed by a visiting Tech-Priest Magos is oftentimes worth the investment for a variety of reasons. Usually products of better craftsmanship take up less space or power, due to the more-efficient workings of their ancient designs.

All of these factors must come into play when the crew plan their acquisitions, perhaps even more so when times are good than when times are lean. Just as only a thin hull stands between air and the void, so does the prepared mind stand between disastrous poverty and long-term wealth. *Table: Component Craftsmanship Modifiers*, represents how the level of quality and craftsmanship for a Component affects its Acquisition and Installation, while *Table: Lance and Macrobattery Craftsmanship Modifiers* shows the performance effects on Lance and Macrobattery weapons (this table should be used instead of *Table: Component Craftsmanship Modifiers*). Other weapons should use *Table: Component Craftsmanship Modifiers*. 

Note that a modifier cannot take any original value to zero; should this occur the modified value becomes 1. Even the most well crafted Components need power to function and space to occupy. However, if the original Space or Power requirements were zero, Craftsmanship does not increase these requirements (even in the case of Poor Craftsmanship). No matter how shoddy the armour plating on a warship, for example, they still do not require Power to operate.

In addition, although Poor Craftsmanship Components reduce Ship Point costs by 1, this can only be reduced to a minimum of 1.

## Craftsmanship And Morale

A ship runs on more than just plasma and adamantium. It also runs on the crew's morale, their faith in their ship and those who command her. Much of the morale level at any given time is determined by what the crew see around them—the ship itself. When they see their masters improving the ship with better Components, they feel more confident in their lot. An ancient cogitator, musty with old smells and covered with seals of numistic purity, lifts the spirits of the most downtrodden ratings. Alternatively, a rusting life sustainer dripping vitae-unguents lowers expectations of survival. 

To represent this, after a Component is installed the ship's Morale is immediately modified based on the Craftsmanship Level as per Table Component Craftsmanship Modifiers. The modifier cannot reduce Morale to below half or take it to above the ship's maximum level. This is not a permanent loss, and may be regained to the ship's maximum.

## Component Craftsmanship Modifiers

| Craftsmanship  | Power | Space | SP | Morale |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Poor | -2 to Generated Power or +1 to Power Consumed | +1 | -1 | -1d5 | 
| Common | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
| Good (choose either Power or Space Modifier but not both) | +1 to Generated Power or -1 to Power Consumed | -1 | +1 | +1 | 
| Best | +1 to Generated Power or -1 to Power Consumed | -1 | +2 | +1d5 | 

## Lance and Macrobattery Craftsmanship Modifiers

| Craftsmanship | Strength | Damage | Crit Rating | Range | Space | SP | Morale | 
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Poor (choose any 2) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1d5 | 
| Common | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 
| Good (choose any 1) | 0 | +1 | 0 | +1 | -1 | +1 | +1 | 
| Best (choose any 2) | +1 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | +2 | +1d5 | 

## Common Facility Types & Modifiers

| Facility | Acquisition and Component Modifiers | Installation Modifier | 
|---|---|---|
| Backwater System | Starship Components are rare and expensive in backwater systems. All Component Availabilities count as one step rarer (Rare becomes Very Rare, for example). | +1d10 days | 
| Civilised System | The standard dockyards for most Explorers. | No modifiers. | None | 
| Colonial System | While most Components can be found, there are few Essential ones the colony can spare. All Essential Component Availabilities count as one step rarer (Rare becomes Very Rare, for example). | +1d5 days | 
| Deep Void Station | A wide variety of all Component types can be found here, but the deal making is tough. Decrease the Availability level of any Component by one, only to find if a Component is available. However, the actual Acquisition Test suffers a –5 penalty. | -1 day | 
| Feral/Feudal System | No Components available, but plenty of manpower to be had. Crew may be replenished as Abundant (+50). | N/A | 
| Liege System | The ruler can get whatever is needed, but for a price. All Component Availabilities count as one step rarer (Rare becomes Very Rare, for example). | +1 day | 
| Mining System | Hull repairs are usually easy to come by, and Explorers only have to make an Acquisition Test for every full ten points of Hull Integrity restored. | +1 day | 
| Naval Installation | All Components except Xenotech can be found, but only Rogue Traders with Peer or Good Reputation (Imperial Navy) may purchase Components at a Naval Installation. All Component Availabilities count as one step more common (Rare becomes Scarce, for example). Efficient workmen mean repairs only need 1 day for each 2 points of Hull Integrity restored. | -1 day |
