# Injury 

The life of a Player in the 41st millennium is filled with physical stress\. Devastating weapons effects, horrid creature attacks, baleful mental tortures, and more can reduce a character to a bleeding lump of flesh in desperate need of medicae assistance\. Other actions, such as sprinting across a minefield, can also lessen a character's effectiveness\. Common physical injuries to Players are represented by damage and Fatigue\. Additionally, characters can also experience several types of conditions and special damage such as fire, suffocation, and limb loss\. It is important to know how much physical abuse a character can take, and a key measurement of this is how many wounds he possesses\. 

## Wounds 

Wounds are a measurement of how much punishment a character can take before suffering debilitating effects and ultimately death\. Every character has a specified number of wounds\. Wounds do not normally deplete\. Even when a character is injured, that injury does not decrease his wounds\. Instead, a character's wounds simply serve as a threshold, and the injury is recorded on his character sheet as damage\. When a character's damage exceeds his wounds, however, his life is put at risk\. 

### Damage 

Damage is physical trauma dealt to a character\. Acolytes can suffer damage a number ways, including being shot by an autogun, stabbed by an rusted cultist blade, run over by a tank, exposed to the hard vacuum of space, and so forth\. When a Player Character suffers damage, record the amount on his character sheet\. That damage remains with the character until it is removed over time by natural healing, or the character receives medical attention\. Damage is cumulative; each time a character suffers damage, the amount is added to any previous damage he had\. 

Each time a character is dealt damage, there are factors that might allow him to reduce it before it is applied to his total\. By default, a character reduces incoming damage from each hit by an amount equal to his Toughness bonus\. Armour can also help further reduce damage\. If the source of the damage struck a location protected by armour, the incoming damage is reduced by an amount equal to the Armour points provided by the armour\. It is important to note that some sources of damage ignore Armour and/ or Toughness; such cases are always detailed in the description of the damage source\. As long as a character's total damage is equal to or less than his wounds, his body still functions normally\. If a character's damage ever exceeds his wounds, he begins to take Critical damage\. 

### Damage Types 

All damage is divided up into four types: 

- Energy (E) \(lasers, fire, plasma\) 
- Explosive (X) \(grenades, bolt rounds\) 
- Impact (I) \(clubs, bullets, falling\) 
- Rending (R) \(swords, blades, claws\) 

If a source of damage does not specify a type, treat it as Impact\. The type of damage inflicted is usually only important for determining Critical Effects resulting from Critical damage\. 

### Critical Damage 

Whenever a character's total damage exceeds his wounds, he begins to take Critical damage\. Each time a character suffers Critical damage, he also suffers one or more Critical Effects\. These are determined by consulting the appropriate Critical Effect table based on the affected location \(Arm, Body, Head, or Leg\) and the damage type \(Energy, Explosive, Impact, or Rending\)\. As with normal damage, Critical damage is cumulative and remains with the character until he either heals naturally over time or receives medical attention\. Each Critical Effect also has its own duration \(sometimes permanent\)\. If a Critically damaged character suffers more damage, the amount is added to his existing Critical damage and a new set of Critical Effects are applied based on his total Critical damage \(assuming he is still alive\)\. Note that this new Critical damage does not override or negate the previous Critical damage effects unless the two effects are mutually exclusive, in which case, use the most recent Critical damage effect\.

### Removing Damage 

Characters automatically remove damage \(both ordinary and Critical\) over time through natural healing\. Medical attention and some psychic powers can also remove damage\. The rate of damage removal depends on several factors and is fully explained in Healing\.

## Fatigue 

Not all injuries are lethal\. Exhaustion, combat trauma, or swapping licks with bare fists can all leave a character battered but more or less intact\. Fatigue represents the amount of non\-lethal injury a character can take over the course of game play\. Characters suffer Fatigue from certain types of attacks, Grappling, some Critical Effects, and other actions that push them beyond safe limits\. Fatigue is measured in levels\. 

Any time a character gains or loses a level of Fatigue, he compares his new Fatigue level to his characteristic bonuses\. Any characteristic with a bonus lower than the character's current Fatigue level becomes “fatigued\.” Fatigued characteristics affect the character is different ways depending on if the game is currently in narrative time or structured time: 

- Structured Time: A fatigued characteristic counts as half its normal value \(rounded up\) when the character wishes to perform an action that includes a test that calls on that characteristic, or any other uses of that characteristic\. 
- Narrative Time: Any time the character performs a task that includes a test of a fatigued characteristic, that task takes twice the normal time to attempt\. 

### Fatigue Threshold 

A character's Fatigue threshold is equal to his Toughness bonus and Willpower bonus added together\. If a character's levels of Fatigue ever exceeds this threshold, the character passes out and is Unconscious for 10–TB minutes; at the end of that time, he awakens with his levels of Fatigue reverted to a number equal to his Toughness bonus\. If a character's Fatigue ever exceeds double the amount of his Fatigue threshold, the character dies\. 

### Removing Fatigue 

Fatigue goes away with time\. Each hour of normal rest \(but not time spent Unconscious\) without any combat, use of psychic powers, or other strenuous activity, removes one level of Fatigue\. Six consecutive hours of rest removes all Fatigue\.

## Characteristic Damage 

Some psychic powers, poisons, diseases and other hazards circumvent a character's wounds and deal damage directly to a characteristic\. Characteristic damage cannot reduce a characteristic below zero\. It can also affect the corresponding characteristic bonus\. Effects of Zero Characteristic summarizes what happens when a particular characteristic is reduced to zero\. 

### Removing Characteristic Damage 

Unless otherwise specified, characteristic damage is never permanent\. A character automatically removes one point of characteristic damage each hour, regardless of his activity level\. The GM can allow certain types of medical attention to remove characteristic damage at a faster rate\.

Zero Willpower      |The character falls into a nightmare-filled sleep and is Unconscious.                                                   
Zero Fellowship     |The character withdraws into a blank, catatonic state. He cannot communicate or make tests based on this characteristic.

## Narrative Effects of Wounds 

In addition to the mechanical effects of receiving a wound, some players might want to play out the narrative effects of some of their character's more brutal injuries\. Perhaps a vicious wound to an Acolyte's leg from a chainsword leaves him with a slight limp, or a scorching blast of fire to the head burns off half of his hair\. Adding details like this can add to a character's personality, and make important encounters much more memorable\.

## Conditions and Special Damage 

Common injuries are far from the only forms of bodily harm facing those who fight to preserve Mankind across the scarred battlefields or dark underhives of the galaxy\. Acolytes can find themselves set on fire, or suffering from horribly bleeding wounds, broken bones, or permanent loss of limbs\. All of these, and more, are collectively known as conditions and special damage\. 

### Amputated Limbs 

Whenever a character loses a limb \(besides his head, as that usually means instant death\), he also suffers Blood Loss\. If he survives the experience, he \(or another character\) must treat the stump\. This does not require a test, but the character performing it must have training in the Medicae skill\. If he succeeds, it heals properly and he is no longer in direct danger\. If he does not receive treatment, however, roll 1d10; on a result of 8 or lower, he dies a horrible death from infection over the next 1d10 days\. After losing a limb, a character does not remove damage through natural healing for 1d10\+2 days\. 

Lost Hand 

The character suffers a –20 penalty on all skill and characteristic tests that rely on the use of two hands, and he cannot wield twohanded weapons\. He can, however, strap a shield to the injured arm to offer some use in combat\. 

#### Lost Arm

As with a lost hand, but a character cannot strap a shield to the arm since he no longer has it\. Unless he acquires a bionic replacement, his ability to serve the Emperor is greatly reduced\. 

#### Lost Eye

Losing one eye permanently reduces a character's Ballistic Skill by 10\. In addition, he suffers a –20 penalty to all skill and characteristics tests that rely on sight\. Should a character have the misfortune to lose both eyes, he becomes Blinded\.

#### Lost Foot 

The character permanently reduces all his Movement by half \(rounded up\) and suffers a –20 penalty on all tests for Movement actions, as well as skill and characteristic tests that could rely on mobility, such as Stealth\. 

#### Lost Leg 

Treat this as a lost foot, but the character cannot use the Dodge skill\. Losing both legs means the character cannot walk unless he has suitable cybernetic replacements installed\.

### Blinded 

A Blinded character automatically fails all tests based on vision, and automatically fails all Ballistic Skill tests\. He also suffers a –30 penalty to Weapon Skill tests and most other tests that ordinarily benefit from vision\. Luckily, bionic eyes are a relatively commonplace cybernetic replacement in the Imperium\. 

### Blood Loss 

Blood Loss is a condition that can result from Critical damage\. At the start of his turn, an affected character suffers 1 level of Fatigue\. Once per round as a Free Action, he \(or another character who can reach him\) can attempt a Difficult \(–10\) Medicae test to remove this condition\. The GM should modify the test as needed if the character is performing a strenuous activity or under attack, or if the subject is not in active combat or using more actions\. Note that multiple Blood Loss conditions do not stack\. 

### Deafened 

The character cannot hear at all, or at least not well enough to communicate with others\. Until he recovers or has the damage repaired, he automatically fails any skill or characteristic test that relies on hearing\. Apart from having trouble communicating with his fellow Players, the GM is free to decide what effects the character's deafness has on the game\. 

### Falling 

Players can fall off things for all manner of reasons, though the results are usually the same\. When a character falls a dangerous distance \(as determined by the GM\), he suffers falling damage\. The falling character suffers 1d10 Impact damage, plus 1 additional damage per metre he fell, to a randomly determined Hit Location\. Damage from a fall ignores Armour \(but not Toughness\)\. The GM can adjust the damage depending on the type of surface landed upon, abnormal gravity conditions, and other factors\. 

### Fire 

A character can be set on fire in several different ways \(none of them pleasant\)\. First, weapons with the Flame quality and certain Energy Critical Effects can set a character on fire\. Alternatively, a character can be ignited by fire in the environment; for this second case, at the beginning of each round after the first in which the character is exposed to the same source of flames, he must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Agility test or catch on fire\. Once a character is on fire, he suffers 1d10 Energy damage \(ignoring Armour\) and suffers 1 level of Fatigue each round until the fire is extinguished\. If the location is not otherwise specified, this applies to the Body location\. While on fire, he must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Willpower test at the beginning of each of his turns in order to be able to take actions normally; otherwise, he may only flail in agony and scream, which counts as a Full Action\. A character who is on fire can try to extinguish the flames by dropping Prone and making a Hard \(–20\) Agility test as a Full Action\. The GM can make this test easier or harder depending on environmental conditions and whether the blazing character is able to receive any help from nearby allies\. 

### Stunned 

In addition to damage and Fatigue, characters can also become Stunned due to certain attacks or effects\. Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill tests to hit Stunned characters gain a \+20 bonus\. Stunned characters cannot take actions or Reactions such as Evasion, but are not considered a Helpless or Unaware targets\. 

### Suffocation 

There are many ways to suffocate, including drowning, smoke inhalation, and exposure to certain toxins\. The rate of suffocation depends on the character's activity level\. If a character is actively trying to conserve oxygen, he can hold his breath for a number of minutes equal to his Toughness bonus\. If a character is instead engaged in strenuous activity \(combat, swimming, and so forth\) he can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to twice his Toughness bonus\. While holding his breath, a character must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Toughness test each minute \(if conserving oxygen\) or each round \(if engaged in strenuous activity\)\. If he fails, he suffers one level of Fatigue\. If the character has not gained a fresh source of oxygen by the end of the allotted time, he automatically falls Unconscious regardless of his levels of Fatigue\. If a character is both Unconscious and deprived of a fresh source of oxygen, he dies after a number of rounds equal to his Toughness bonus\. 

### Unconsciousness 

Unconsciousness is usually a temporary state that typically results from excessive levels of Fatigue or Critical damage\. The duration of a state of Unconsciousness is usually included in the description of the effect that caused it, but if no other duration is given, Unconsciousness lasts for 10 minutes\. An Unconscious character is completely unaware of his surroundings and cannot take any actions\. He is also treated as a Helpless target\. If a character falls into Unconsciousness due to excessive levels of Fatigue, he recovers some of that Fatigue when he awakens\.

### Useless Limbs 

Though the human form has many vulnerabilities, human limbs can often be snapped, shattered, and shredded before they are lost completely\. Limbs can be rendered Useless by certain Critical Effects\. While a limb is Useless, its owner suffers all of the penalties associated with having lost that limb \(see the Lost Hand, Lost Arm, Lost Eye, Lost Foot, and Lost Leg conditions\)\. The limb is not actually severed, however, so its owner does not suffer Blood Loss and the other effects that accompany an Amputated Limb\.

### Vacuum 

There is nothing pleasant about being exposed to vacuum\. There are two main ways this unfortunate event could occur: 

- A character can be suddenly thrust into an airless, unpressurised environment \(such as being unexpectedly expelled from an airlock into space\)\. 
- A character can be slowly affected \(such as being on a damaged voidship as atmosphere is vented into space\)\. 

A character exposed to vacuum can survive unharmed for a number of rounds equal to his Toughness bonus\. At the end of each round after this, he suffers 1d10 Explosive damage \(ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus\)\. Since vacuums are airless by definition, a character in a vacuum also begins suffering the effects of Suffocation unless he has an oxygen source\. If a character is in the vacuum of space, at the end of each round he must make a Challenging \(\+0\) Toughness test or suffer 1d10 Energy damage from the extreme cold \(ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus\)\. If a character dies in space, it takes five rounds for his corpse to freeze\. If a frozen corpse suffers any damage, it shatters into thousands of blood\-red ice shards\. If a character is trapped in a gradually worsening atmosphere, he can survive unharmed for a number of rounds equal to twice his Toughness bonus\. At the end of this time, he begins to experience Suffocation and depressurisation \(as detailed above\)\. However, the damage for the decompression is only 1d5 instead of 1d10\.

## Healing 

A character inevitably suffers damage during his battles in the name of the Emperor\. As a character accumulates damage, he progresses through three different states: Lightly Damaged, Heavily Damaged, and Critically Damaged\. 

### Lightly Damaged 

A character is considered Lightly Damaged if he has taken damage equal to or less than twice his Toughness bonus\. A Lightly Damaged character removes 1 point of damage per day through natural healing\. If a Lightly Damaged character devotes an entire day to bed rest, he removes an amount of damage equal to his Toughness bonus\. Once he removes all damage, a character ceases to be Lightly Damaged\. 

### Heavily Damaged 

A character is Heavily Damaged whenever he has taken more damage than twice his Toughness bonus\. A Heavily Damaged character does not remove damage unless he devotes himself to complete rest \(such as when receiving extended care, as per the Medicae skill\)\. If he does so, the character removes 1 point of damage at the end of each 24–hour period\. Once a Heavily Damaged character's damage is equal to or less than twice his Toughness bonus, he becomes Lightly Damaged instead\. 

### Critically Damaged 

A character is Critically Damaged whenever he has taken damage in excess of his wounds\. A Critically Damaged character does not remove damage unless he devotes himself to complete rest \(such as when receiving extended care, as per the Medicae skill\)\. If he does so, the character makes a Challenging \(\+0\) Toughness test at the end of each 24–hour period\. If he succeeds, he removes 1 point of Critical damage\. Once all Critical damage has been removed, a character becomes Heavily Damaged instead\. 

### Medical Attention 

Medical attention can range from the application of healing drugs to a successful Medicae test\. Medical attention can provide immediate recovery or can speed the process of natural healing\. For additional information, see the Medicae skills\. Medical attention can also be something granted between game sessions by the GM, and would not necessarily be tied to Medicae tests or other skills that any character might have\. This is up to the GM to establish, and would usually involve the passage of time via narrative time, although this should be done to help speed the game along\. A GM should avoid leaving players in situations where they have a Heavily or Critically Damaged character and due to this are unable to participate in the game\. 

### Cybernetic and Bionic Replacements 

It is possible—and often a good idea—to restore lost limbs with bionic replacements\. In fact, sometimes an Acolyte might prefer to lop off a perfectly good arm to gain the benefits of having a cybernetic replacement to better honour the Omnissiah\. See Armoury for how cybernetic and bionic replacements work as well as the process for obtaining them\.
