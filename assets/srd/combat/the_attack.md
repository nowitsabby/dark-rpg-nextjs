# The Attack 

The most common action in combat is the attack—the characters are fighting, after all. Whether armed with a melee or ranged weapon, the process is the same. Before an attack is made, the GM should verify that the attack is even possible by checking the basic requirements for the attack. Melee attacks require the attacker to be engaged in melee combat with her target. Ranged attacks cannot be made if the attacker is engaged in melee, unless she is firing a Pistol\-class weapon. In either case, the attacker must be aware of her target; see the Spray and Pray for additional information. Assuming the attack is possible, follow these steps: 

- __Step One:__ Apply Modifiers to Attacker's Characteristic 
- __Step Two:__ Attacker Makes a Test 
- __Step Three:__ Attacker Determines Hit Location 
- __Step Four:__ Attacker Determines Damage 
- __Step Five:__ Target Applies Damage

## Step One: Apply Modifiers to Attacker's Characteristic 

A melee attack requires the attacker to make a Weapon Skill test. A ranged attack requires the attacker to make a Ballistic Skill test. There are many instances where one or more factors make performing an attack easier or more difficult than normal. For example, using the Full Auto Burst attack action imposes a –10 penalty on the attacker's Ballistic Skill test, whereas a Standard Attack grants a \+10 bonus whether the attack is melee or ranged. The GM can also impose additional penalties or bonuses to the test if the situation warrants it. If a situation calls for two or more bonuses or penalties, simply combine all modifiers together and apply the total to the appropriate characteristic. The maximum total bonus that can be applied to a test is \+60. Conversely, the maximum total penalty that can be applied to a test is –60. When adjudicating difficulty, common sense should prevail. Regardless of the usual limits on test penalties, some actions are simply impossible, and no test is permissible.

## Step Two: Attacker Makes a Test 

After the modified characteristic has been determined, the attacker makes a Weapon Skill test if she is performing a melee attack, or a Ballistic Skill test if performing a ranged attack. Either of these is resolved like any other test. If the roll is equal to or less than the modified characteristic, the attack hits.

### Evasion Reactions 

When a target is hit by an attack, it can have a chance to negate the hit with an Evasion reaction. If it succeeds at its Evasion reaction and manages to negate all hits, the attack fails and no damage is dealt.

### Stray Shots 

GMs keen on reinforcing the merciless nature of the 41st Millennium can rule that if a character shooting into a melee combat misses her target by a small margin \(one degree of failure\), the attack instead hits another target engaged in the same melee. The GM might also rule that anyone shooting into a melee combat with a Semi\-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst must allocate multiple hits to different targets engaged in the melee.

### Spray and Pray 

Situations might arise where a character is aware of a danger stalking her, but is unable to see it. In these cases, a character can use her attack for the turn to wildly fire or strike out in hopes of hitting her hidden antagonist. In these cases, it is up to the Game Master to determine a number between 1 and 100 that represents the character's percentage chance of hitting her target, or if the character is even firing in the correct direction at all. Then, during Step Two of the attack, the Game Master rolls 1d100 and compares the result to the percentage chance. If she rolls equal to or under the number, the attack proceeds as normal. If she rolls over the number, the attack misses the hidden opponent, and has no effect other than perhaps drawing even more unwanted attention to the unfortunate character and her actions.

### Weapon Jams 

Weapons can jam through extreme age, maltreatment of their machine spirit, or just plain poor design. An unmodified result of 96–100 on a Ranged attack indicates the weapon has jammed. This means the attack automatically misses, and the weapon cannot be fired until the jam is cleared. Clearing a jam is a Full Action that requires a Ballistic Skill test. If the character attempting to clear the jam succeeds on the test, then the jam has been cleared, though the weapon needs to be reloaded and any ammo in it is lost. If she fails on the test, the weapon is still jammed, though she can attempt to clear it again next round. Some weapons, such as plasma guns, grenades, and missiles, carry extra risks associated with jamming. For these weapons, refer to their descriptions and weapon special qualities. Semi\-automatic and fully automatic fire also increases the likelihood of jamming; this is described within the Semi\-Auto Burst, Full Auto Burst, and Suppressing Fire actions.

## Step Three: Attacker Determines Hit Location 

On a successful hit, the attacker needs to determine where the hit landed. Using the percentile dice result from the attacker's Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill test \(or the Focus Power test, in the case of psychic attacks\), reverse the order of the digits \(e.g., a roll of 32 becomes 23, a roll of 20 becomes 02, and so on\) and compare this number to Hit Locations 

### Hit Locations
__Roll__ | __Location__
--------|---------
01 – 10 |Head
11 – 20 |Right Arm
21 – 30 |Left Arm
31 – 70 |Body
71 – 85 |Right Leg
86 – 100|Left Leg

### Multiple Hits                  
__First Hit__ | __Second Hit__ | __Third Hit__ | __Fourth Hit__ | __Fifth Hit__ | __Each Additional Hit__
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Head | Head | Arm | Body | Arm | Body 
Arm | Arm | Body | Head | Body | Arm 
Body | Body | Arm | Head | Arm | Body 
Leg | Leg | Body | Arm | Head | Body 

## Step Four: Attacker Determines Damage 

After the Hit Location has been determined, the attacker determines the damage dealt by each hit the attack inflicted. Each weapon has a damage listing, which is usually a die roll, plus or minus a number. Roll the appropriate die and apply any indicated modifiers for each hit. Finally, if the attack involved a melee weapon, add the attacker's Strength bonus. The result is the damage total. 

For all attack rolls, count the degrees of success. *The attacker can replace the result on a single damage die with the number of degrees of success from her attack roll*. If the attack inflicts more than one hit or more than one die of damage, the attacker can replace the result on one die of her choice with the degrees of success from the attack roll. If a natural 10 is rolled any damage die for a given hit, the hit inflicts Righteous Fury.

### Righteous Fury 

When rolling damage after a successful hit, if any die rolled results in a natural 10 \(rolling the 10 result on a 10 sided die\), a particularly bloody and spectacular hit might be inflicted. This also includes a result of 10 when rolling 1d5 for damage. After resolving the effects of the hit, one of two things can happen. 

If the hit dealt damage after being reduced by Armour and Toughness bonus, then the hit becomes more severe. The attacker then rolls 1d5 and consults the Critical Effects table appropriate to the damage type and location of the original attack. The target suffers all effects listed. However, the target does not count as having suffered Critical damage. In other words, if she takes damage during later turns, it affects her wounds, not directly stacking onto worsening Critical Effects. Talents that modify Critical damage \(such as Deathdealer and True Grit\) do not modify the critical effects generated by Righteous Fury, and these effects do not stack if a target suffers Righteous Fury multiple times. Each roll is applied as a separate effect. 

Alternatively, if the hit does not deal any damage once reduced by Armour and Toughness bonus, then the hit deals 1 point of damage, not reduced by Armour or Toughness. This is the extent of the Righteous Fury effect for this hit; the victim does not suffer a roll on a Critical Effect table. This represents some weapons simply not being potent enough to deal major damage, but still able to do harm through a “lucky shot.”

### Righteous Fury for Player Characters and NPCs 

Righteous Fury is something that both Player Characters and major NPCs can inflict and suffer. This means if a cult magos shoots a Player Character and rolls a 10 for damage, then the Player Character suffers a 1d5 Critical Effect result. This makes combat gritty, dangerous, and more dynamic, as the characters can suffer from flavourful \(and often awful\) Critical damage, and can leave combat with interesting new scars. However, in order to ensure that combat does not bog down too much, when a low\-level NPC \(a faceless soldier or minion, usually an unnamed NPC not central to the story plot\) suffers Righteous Fury, she is simply slain instead. These Troop level NPCs also usually cannot benefit from this rule when inflicting damage on the Player.

These rules make for faster game play, but if all players agree, then all types of NPCs including low\-level Troops can use the Righteous Fury rules. This might slow down gameplay, but it also allows for the PCs to truly prove their skills in combat. After all, the Emperor knows your worth by your scars, and when playing in this manner, the Players are certain to gain quite a few.

### Zealous Hatred

Some sources reference Zealous Hatred instead of Righteous Fury. These terms are interchangeable, use whichever fits thematically

## Step Five: Target Applies Damage 

From the damage total, the target subtracts her Toughness bonus and any Armour points that protect the location that the attack struck. If this reduces the damage to zero or less, the target shrugs off the hit. The target records any remaining damage, adding it to any previously suffered, and then compares this total to her total amount of wounds. If the target's damage equals or exceeds her wounds, she notes any excess damage as Critical damage, and the GM consults the appropriate table based on the type of damage, the location hit, and the amount of Critical damage accumulated. See Critical Damage.

# Unarmed Combat 

Not every fight requires lasguns and chainswords. Some conflicts can be settled the old\-fashioned way, with fists or even teeth. Unarmed attacks are treated just like those from any other melee weapon, and successful hits inflict 1d5–3\+SB Impact damage with no penetration. If this inflicts damage equal to or greater than the target's Toughness bonus, it also inflicts one level of Fatigue. Whenever an unarmed character attempts to strike an armed foe \(one currently wielding a Melee or Pistol weapon\), or Parry an armed foe's attacks, she suffers a –20 penalty on her Weapon Skill tests.

### Grappling 

Instead of inflicting damage with an unarmed attack, a character can attempt to Grapple her opponent. Attempting a Grapple is a melee attack that uses either a Charge action or a Standard Attack action. The attacker makes a Weapon Skill test as normal. The target of the Grapple may use a Reaction, if able, to avoid the attack. If the attack is successful, the attacker and the target start to Grapple, with the attacker controlling the Grapple. In a Grapple, all of the following apply: 

- Participants in a Grapple cannot use Reactions. 
- Participants in a Grapple are considered to be engaged in melee combat. 
- Participants in a Grapple can only use the Grapple action. 
- The controller of the Grapple can voluntarily end the Grapple at any point during her turn as a Free Action. 
- Other attackers gain a \+20 bonus to Weapon Skill tests to hit any target engaged in a Grapple. 
- Only two characters can be engaged in the same Grapple, but up to two other characters can lend Assistance to each Grappler in certain situations.

#### Grapple Action

This action is only used when a character is already engaged in a Grapple. If the active character is controlling the Grapple, the first thing she must do on her turn is declare Grapple as a Full Action in order to maintain the Grapple; if she does not declare Grapple as her Full Action, the Grapple immediately ends. After that, she can choose one of the following Controller Grapple Options: 

- __Damage Opponent:__ The controller of the Grapple can attempt to damage her opponent with brute force by making an Opposed Strength test with the Grappled opponent. If the active character wins, she inflicts unarmed damage \(1d5–3\+SB\) to her opponent's Body location and one level of Fatigue. If the grappled opponent wins the Opposed Strength test, no damage is dealt, but she remains Grappled. This test can benefit from Assistance. 
- __Throw Down Opponent:__ The controller of the Grapple can attempt to wrestle her Grappled opponent to the ground by making an Opposed Strength test. This test can benefit from Assistance. If the active character wins, the Grappled opponent becomes Prone. The controller can choose to end the Grapple at this point as a Free Action, or may continue to Grapple the Prone opponent, gaining a \+10 to all further Opposed tests made during this Grapple until the Prone opponent manages to stand \(assuming she is able to\). This bonus is in addition to the standard \+10 gained when attacking Prone opponents. 
- __Push Opponent:__ The controller can attempt to force her Grappled opponent to move. This is resolved with an Opposed Strength test, which can benefit from Assistance. If the active character succeeds, she pushes her opponent one metre in a direction of her choice, plus one additional metre for each degree of success. This pushed distance cannot exceed the active character's Half Move distance. The active character must move with her Grappled opponent in order to maintain the Grapple, or she can choose to let go of her opponent as a Free Action, which ends the Grapple, but allows the active character to keep her ground.
- __Ready:__ The controller of the Grapple can ready one of her own items. Or if the GM allows, she can use the Ready action to grab an item belonging to her Grappled opponent. 
- __Stand:__ If both participants are on the ground, the controller of the Grapple can regain her feet with this action. She can also attempt to drag her opponent up with her by making an Opposed Strength test. This test can benefit from Assistance. If the controller of the Grapple wins, both participants stand. 
- __Use Item:__ The controller can use a readied item if desired.

#### Grappled Target Options: 
If the active character is the target of the Grapple, the first thing she must do on her turn is declare Grapple as a Half Action—this is part of the penalty for being Grappled. After that, she can choose one of the following 
- __Break Free:__ The Grappled target can attempt to break free of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength test against the controller of the Grapple. This test can benefit from Assistance. If the active character wins, she breaks free and may perform any Half Action. 
- __Slip Free:__ The Grappled target can attempt to wriggle out of the Grapple by making a Challenging \(\+0\) Acrobatics test. If she succeeds, she slips free and may perform any Half Action. 
- __Take Control:__ The Grappled target can attempt to take control of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength test against her Grappling opponent. This test can benefit from Assistance. If the active character wins, she becomes the controller of the Grapple and her opponent becomes the Grappled target. The active character may then immediately perform one of the Controller Grapple Options, but she cannot take any other Half Actions. 

#### Grappling Size Differences

If one character is larger than the other, the larger scores one extra degree of success on successful Opposed tests performed as part of the Grapple for every point by which the value of her Size trait exceeds her opponent's Size trait.

# Two\-Weapon Fighting 

Many warriors fight with a weapon in either hand, and there are advantages and disadvantages to this style of fighting. While it offers some improved opportunities to make attacks, it also reduces the chances of successfully striking a target. The character can use any melee weapons or ranged weapons that can be reasonably used in one hand. These are generally Pistol class ranged weapons \(though some Basic class weapons can have modifications that allow them to be used with one hand, or simply used with a penalty\), and melee weapons that note they are one\-handed weapons in their descriptions. 

- The character can use either hand to make an attack. 
- If the character has the Two\-Weapon Wielder talent, she can attack with both weapons, but each attack suffers a –20 penalty to the Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill test. 
- If the character has the Ambidextrous talent, the penalty to the attack is lessened. Her penalty for fighting with two weapons drops to –10, but note that other talents or situational modifiers can possibly further affect these modifiers. 
- If the character is wielding at least one melee weapon, she may use the Parry skill to perform an Evasion reaction once each round as normal with this weapon, though she still cannot Evade more than once in a round. 
- If a character with the Two\-Weapon Wielder \(Melee\) talent is armed with two melee weapons, she can perform a melee Attack action \(either a Standard Attack, Swift Attack, or Lightning Attack\) with one of these weapons. She can then perform a melee Attack action \(either a Standard Attack, Swift Attack, or Lightning Attack\) with the other weapon, with any applicable modifiers to the test. These attacks can be made against any target in melee. 
- If a character with the Two\-Weapon Wielder \(Ballistic\) talent is armed with two Pistols \(or other ranged weapons that can reasonably be wielded in one hand\), she can perform a ranged Attack action \(either a Standard Attack, Semi\-Auto Burst, or Full\-Auto Burst\) with one of these weapons. If she does so, she can then perform another ranged Attack action \(either a Standard Attack, Semi\-Auto Burst, or Full Auto Burst\) with her second weapon. 
- When firing a ranged weapon with each hand, the character may fire each weapon on a different mode, for example, one on full automatic and one on semi\-automatic. When firing a full automatic weapon in each hand, the character can only lay down one area of suppressive fire. 
- If a character with the Two\-Weapon Wielder \(Melee\) and Two Weapon Wielder \(Ballistic\) talent is armed with a Melee weapon in one hand and a one\-handed ranged weapon in the other, she may perform a melee attack action \(either a Standard Attack, Swift Attack, or Lightning Attack\) or ranged attack action \(such as Standard Attack, Semi\-Auto Burst, or Full Auto Burst\) with one weapon. She may then make a second melee attack action or ranged attack action with her secondary weapon. Any ranged weapon hits must be inflicted upon targets in melee. Resolve each attack separately by testing Weapon Skill for the melee weapon and Ballistic Skill for the ranged weapon. 
- The character can fire two weapons at different targets, though the targets must be within 10 metres of each other.
