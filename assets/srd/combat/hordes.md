# Hordes

The enemies of can attack in vast numbers— howling zealots, skittering Hordes, and ranked warriors\. Alone, such enemies would stand no chance against a Space Marine\. In large groups, however, they can pose an overwhelming threat\. Hordes have the potential to harm by sheer weight of fire and numbers\. The rules presented here are intended to help Game Masters reflect these massed forces that the characters may face in battle\. It is important to note that not every enemy is suitable to form a Horde\. The GM should use his discretion to decide whether an enemy can form a Horde\. For example, it is unlikely that 50 jungle snakes would be a threat, even as a Horde\! However, 50 Tyranid Hormagaunts will certainly threaten a trained Cadre of Chaos Space Marines\. When a creature has a Special Quality for its attacks \(e\.g\., Tearing or Toxic\), the default method is to apply that Quality to all of the attacks for a Horde made up of that creature\. However, the GM should use his discretion for when the Quality should not apply \(for instance, if over half of the creatures in the Horde do not possess that Quality\)\. Also, certain Qualities for the Horde's attacks can make an encounter with a Horde particularly dangerous\.

## Using A Horde

A Horde should be treated by the Games Master as a single vast creature\. The Horde has the same profile as the base creature which makes up its numbers\.  The only exception to this is that a Horde replaces the individual creature's Wounds value with its Magnitude and location based armour with a single armour value\.

### Magnitude

A Horde is a vast number of one type of enemy or creature attacking in large numbers\. The abstract number of enemies making up such a Horde are reflected in the Horde's Magnitude\. This represents the Horde's determination and numbers as an abstract value: one point of Magnitude does not equal one individual enemy or creature\.

### Horde Traits

A creature entry may have a Trait listed that has \(Horde\) written next to it\. These Traits represent the way particular creatures fight in large numbers and only apply when that creature is used as the basis of a Horde\.

### Attacking A Horde

A character can damage a Horde by shooting it with ranged weapons or attacking it in melee\. These attacks are treated as if they are against a single creature even though they may represent mowing down ranks of enemies or scything through many foes\. Characters must still roll to hit a Horde, but a size bonus should apply to these tests based on the Horde's Magnitude\. Weapons that can fire on full or semi\-auto cause additional hits\. These hits must be allocated against the Horde and not any individual Lieutenants or Masters that may also be present\. Hordes do not normally Dodge or Parry Attacks\. At the GM's discretion, a Horde can Dodge or Parry attacks just as a single creature does, representing the attacker still killing or wounding individual members of the Horde but not enough to affect overall Magnitude\. A Horde's melee weapons are immune to being shattered by a weapon with Power Field Quality when Parried \(this is an abstraction—in fact, the Horde's weapons are being destroyed, but there are plenty more where those came from\)\. Multiple enemies attacking the same Horde do not gain the benefits of Ganging Up\.

#### Damaging A Horde

Each hit that causes any amount of damage reduces a Horde's Magnitude by one\. Therefore, an attack that, after accounting for armour and Toughness Bonus, causes 15 points of damage reduces the Horde's Magnitude by 1\. The deliberate consequence of this is that sustained fire and blast weapons are much more effective against Hordes than weapons which fire only one shot; a lascannon is a weapon for destroying tanks, not mowing down large numbers of infantry\. Weapons that inflict Explosive Damage \(X\) gain a bonus against Hordes and count as having inflicted one additional Hit per Attack after all other Hits have been applied\. Locations are not used when fighting a Horde\. A Horde has a single armour value that is applied to all damage rather than different armour values for different locations\. Hordes may be Pinned as normal \(with the entire Horde making a single Willpower Test\)\. However, Hordes gain a bonus to their Willpower Tests to resist pinning equal to its Magnitude\.

#### Melee

When fighting against a Horde in Melee, a PC inflicts one hit for every two Degrees of Success on his Weapon Skill Test\. Melee weapons with the Power Field Quality inflict one additional hit\.

#### Blast Weapons

A Blast weapon that hits a Horde hits a number of times equal to its Blast value\. So a grenade with Blast \(4\) will automatically hit four times if successfully lobbed into the Horde\.

#### Flame Weapons

A flame weapon used on a Horde hits it a number of times equal to one quarter of the weapon's range \(rounding up\), plus 1d5\. So a flame weapon with a range of 10 hits a Horde 1d5\+3 times\. A Horde cannot be set on fire and does not suffer the lingering effects of fire; instead, any damage and effects of fire are assumed to be included in the Magnitude damage\.

#### Righteous Fury and Hordes

Righteous Fury has no additional effect on Hordes\. This is because each hit is only affecting one individual in the larger Horde\. No matter how brutal the kill, it has little effect on the dead individual's comrades\.

#### Psychic Powers

Psychic Powers that do direct damage inflict damage against a Horde in the same manner as ranged weapons \(particularly powers with the Psychic Storm and Psychic Blast qualities\)\. At the GM's discretion, certain psychic powers \(such as Compel\) that do not damage may still inflict “hits,” meaning that portions of the Horde have been convinced not to attack, and so forth\. In this case, the number of hits inflicted should equal the Degrees of Success on the Focus Power Test\. Furthermore, the GM should take care to adjudicate the effects of certain psychic powers \(such as Rain of Corruption\) in specific situations against Hordes \(such as a Horde tightly packed into a small space\)\.

#### Breaking A Horde

When a Horde's Magnitude is reduced by 25% in a turn, it must make a Willpower Test when it is its turn to act again\. If it passes, it may continue to act\. If it fails, it breaks and flees at its highest move value\. If the Horde's Magnitude is less than 50% of its starting value, it suffers a –10 to the Willpower Test\. If the Horde's Magnitude is less than 25% of its starting value, it will automatically break\. Hordes composed of enemies with the Fearless talent do not have to test to see if they break as their Magnitude is eroded: they have to be wiped out to the last\.

### Hordes Attacking

A Horde can make both melee attacks against enemies in close proximity and ranged attacks at enemies that are at a distance in a single turn as an attack action\.

Melee: A Horde attacks all adjacent enemies, or enemies that are in close proximity \(the GM is the final arbiter of determining if a target is in close proximity\)\. A Horde that has multiple attacks from being armed with two weapons or the Swift Attack or Lightning Attack Talents may use its full number of attacks against every eligible target\. Although a Horde represents a large number of attackers, a Horde does not gain the benefits of Ganging Up\. Instead, the Horde's sheer weight of numbers is represented by the fact that its target may not Dodge or Parry\. Melee Attacks made by Hordes cannot be Parried or Dodged unless otherwise noted\.

Ranged: A Horde may make ranged attacks equal to the first digit of its Magnitude\. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde can make two ranged attacks\. Any additional hits from sustained fire can be applied to any eligible target\. Therefore, if the heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to Brother Silas\. Modifiers of range and sustained fire apply as normal, but a Horde can never aim\. Ammo expenditure and Jamming never applies to Hordes—they always have extra bullets\.

#### Damage Caused by Hordes

Any attack from a Horde that hits has the damage it causes increased by a number of d10s equal to the Horde's Magnitude divided by ten, with a maximum bonus of \+2d10\. This is in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that the Horde is armed with\. It will also include the Strength Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons\. The damage is reduced by the target's Toughness bonus and armour as normal\. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a heretic would do with its axe \(1d10\+5\) and, therefore, causes 3d10\+5 damage if they hit in combat\. Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10\+2 damage with its ranged attacks\. This represents being mobbed with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking like rain on a single target\.

Generally, the attacks of a Horde may not be Dodged or Parried—this represents the Horde's sheer volume of fi repower\. At the GM's discretion, he may choose to allow certain attacks from a Horde to be Dodged as normal\. For example, a Horde of Imperial Guardsmen may possess a single missile launcher amongst their number\. Since the entire horde is not firing missiles \(they are instead firing lasguns\), the missile launcher does not benefit from the Horde's abilities regarding ranged attacks, and therefore receives no bonus damage and may be Dodged normally\. Hordes cannot inflict Righteous Fury unless specifically noted otherwise\. The damage they could deal is taken into account with the extra dice they roll\.

## Horde Versus Horde

### Combat

Occasionally, there will be cause for two Hordes to face off against each other\. Whether this is an army of renegades facing Imperial Guardsmen or two opposing factions of Chaos Zealots trying to prove whose Patron is superior, combat works similar to the basic Horde rules\. Treat each Horde as if they were an individual character and follow the rules outlined above for calculating their Damage\. When determining the bonus To Hit modifier for size, use the difference between them, with the smaller Horde receiving the benefit\. For example, a Magnitude 30 Horde of Zealots is fighting a Magnitude 60 Horde of Guardsmen\. The Zealots would receive a \+10 To Hit modifier on all attacks made against the Horde of Guardsmen\. Individual Player\-characters involved in Horde versus Horde combat have the option of fighting as individuals or fighting as part of the Horde\. If they choose to fight as part of the Horde, they will still act on their own Initiative, but they may only use Psychic Powers or Daemonic Gifts to differentiate themselves from the Hordes basic attacks\. A character may choose to leave a Horde as a Half Action\.

### Creating A Horde

To create a Horde is simply a matter of taking a low level adversary \(usually a Troops adversary, but sometimes an Elite\) and replacing its wounds with a Magnitude value desired by the GM\.  The one exception is any creature with the Swarm rule\. Swarms are similar to Hordes, but represent groups of even lesser enemies, and the rules do not combine\.
