# Combat Circumstances 

No two combats ever unfold in the same way; each one is a unique experience with different terrain, environments, weather, and a variety of other factors\. Combat circumstances cover any situational effects that have an impact on combat outside of the actions the characters are performing\. 

Many circumstances offer modifications to tests, making them easier or harder to achieve, and often there can be multiple modifications such as fighting in a night\-time rainstorm, or a muddy field on a high\-grav world\. When these combinations occur, simply add the modifiers together \(remembering that positive and negative modifiers cancel each other out\)\. This might bring the overall modifier to a very high number, making the test ridiculously easy or essentially impossible, and in these cases the GM can simply declare the test succeeds or fails with no dice roll needed\. The following circumstances are some of the most common ones encountered in combat\. For situations not covered here, use these as a guide\. Remember, the GM has the final say about the difficulty of any particular test, or the outcome of any unusual situation\.

## Cover 

Given the extreme lethality of weapons in the 41st Millennium, taking cover in combat is often an excellent way to survive\. When a character hides behind cover in a fire\-fight, he conceals a portion of his body, protecting it from enemy fire\. There are no penalties to Ballistic Skill tests made to attack targets standing behind cover\. However, there is a chance that the shot can hit the cover rather than the target\. It is up to the Acolyte to decide which parts of his form he is exposing when behind cover, but as a general rule, a character firing around or over cover will have his Body and Legs concealed\. If the shot would hit a location that is concealed behind cover, work out the damage against the Armour points of the cover instead, with any excess being applied to the target as normal \(see Cover Examples for a guide to the Armour points of different kinds of cover\)\. 

If a Hit Location would benefit from multiple cover bonuses, the character chooses which one he would like to use, and only gains the benefits from that one source\. 

### Damaging Cover 

As attacks strike cover, they can wear it down, reduce its effectiveness, and eventually even destroy it\. Whenever a hit strikes a piece of cover and deals damage that exceeds the cover’s Armour points, that piece of cover has its Armour points reduced by 1\. Cover that has its Armour points reduced to 0 is destroyed and offers no further protection\.

### Example Cover

## Darkness 

Weapon Skill tests made in darkness suffer a –20 penalty, while Ballistic Skill tests suffer a –30 penalty\. While a character is concealed by darkness, he gains a \+20 bonus to Stealth skill tests\.

## Difficult Terrain 

Weapon Skill and Evasion tests made whilst standing in difficult terrain, such as mud, suffer a –10 penalty\. Tests made whilst standing in arduous terrain, such as deep snow or slick ice, instead suffer a –30 penalty, or an even greater one if the GM sees fit\. 

## Engaged in Melee 

If an attacking character is adjacent to his target, both the character and his target are considered to be engaged in melee\. 

### Shooting into Melee 

Combat Ballistic Skill tests made to hit a target engaged in melee combat suffer a –20 penalty\. If one or more characters engaged in the melee are Stunned, Helpless, or Unaware, this penalty is ignored\. 

## Extreme Range 

Targets that are at a distance of more than three times the range of a character’s weapon are at Extreme Range\. Ballistic Skill tests made to hit targets at Extreme Range are suffer a –30 penalty\. fog, mist, shadow, or smoke Ballistic Skill tests made to attack targets concealed by fog, mist, shadow, or smoke suffer a –20 penalty\. While concealed by fog, mist, or shadow, a character gains a \+10 bonus on Stealth skill tests\. 

## Fog, Mist, Shadow, or Smoke 

Ballistic Skill tests made to attack targets concealed by fog, mist, shadow, or smoke suffer a –20 penalty\. While concealed by fog, mist, or shadow, a character gains a \+10 bonus on Stealth skill tests\.

## Ganging Up 

A character has an advantage when he and his allies engage the same foe in melee combat\. If a group of characters outnumber their opponent two to one, their Weapon Skill tests against those foes gain a \+10 bonus\. If a group of characters outnumber their opponent by three to one or more, their Weapon Skill tests against those foes gain a \+20 bonus instead\. 

## Helpless Targets 

Weapon Skill tests made to hit unconscious or otherwise helpless targets automatically succeed with a number of degrees of success equal to the attacker’s Weapon Skill bonus\. When rolling damage against such a target, roll the dice for damage twice and add the results\. Prone and Stunned targets are not automatically considered Helpless Targets\.

## Higher Ground 

Characters standing on higher ground, such as on a table, hill, or mound of dead heretics, have an advantage in melee\. Weapon Skill tests made by these characters with the high ground gain a \+10 bonus\. 

## Long Range 

Targets that are at a distance of more than double the range of a character’s weapon are at Long range\. Ballistic Skill tests made to hit targets at Long range are suffer a –10 penalty\. 

## Missing and Scattering 

Sometimes, when flinging a thrown weapon, it is important to know where the weapon lands should the attacker fail his Ballistic Skill test\. When a character fails this test, the GM rolls 1d10 and consults the Scatter Diagram\. Roll 1d5 to determine the number of metres the item travels in the indicated direction\. This is also used with weapons with the Blast quality\. These affect a wide enough area that if the shot goes awry, it might still damage something, even if what is struck is not the original target\. 

### Scatter Diagram
1|2|3
4|Target|5
6-7|8|9-10

### Scattering in Zero Gravity 

The consequences of throwing dangerous objects in a zero gravity environment can be both amusing and deadly\. One way of determining exactly where an errant krak grenade floats after it bounces off the bulkhead is to roll twice on the Scatter Diagram, once for the X\-axis and once for the Y\-axis\. If the GM desires, he can make a third roll for the Z\-axis when a scatter occurs in huge areas with expansive ceilings or multiple open decks, for example\. 

## Pinning 

Being shot at is a terrifying experience at the best of times, and even the most inexperienced Acolytes know to keep their heads down when the bullets and bolt shells start flying\. Pinning represents a character’s survival instincts telling him to stay in cover\. Certain combat actions or other circumstances call on their targets to test for Pinning; this is a Challenging \(\+0\) Willpower test\. If the character succeeds, he can act normally\. If he fails, he instead becomes Pinned\. 

### Being Pinned 

A Pinned character is busy trying to avoid getting shot, so may only take a single Half Action each turn, though he can take Free Actions and Reactions as normal\. Additionally, he suffers a –20 penalty to all Ballistic Skill tests\. If a Pinned character is in cover relative to the attacker that Pinned him, he may not leave it except to retreat \(provided he can remain in cover while doing so\)\. If he is not in cover when Pinned, he must use his next turn to reach cover\. If there is no cover nearby, he must move away from the attacker that Pinned him\. A character can make a Challenging \(\+0\) Willpower test at the end of his turn to escape Pinning, in which case he may act as normal on his next turn\. If the character has not been shot at since his last turn or is under cover, he gains a \+30 bonus on this test\. A character engaged in melee combat automatically escapes Pinning\. Characters cannot initiate melee combat in an attempt to escape Pinning\.

## Point\-blank Range 

When a character makes a ranged attack against a target that is two metres away or closer, that target is at Point\-Blank range\. Ballistic Skill tests made to attack a target at this range gain a \+30 bonus\. This bonus does not apply when the attacker and the target are engaged in melee combat with each other\. For weapons with a Short range of less than three metres, Point\-Blank range is one metre less than the weapon’s Short range\. 

## Prone 

A character is considered Prone any time he is lying on the ground\. Weapon Skill tests made to attack Prone targets gain a \+10 bonus, but Ballistic Skill tests made to hit Prone targets suffer a –10 penalty unless the attacker is at Point Blank range\. A character who is Prone suffers a –10 penalty to Weapon Skill tests and a –20 penalty to Evasion tests\. 

## Short Range 

Targets that are at a distance of less than half the range of a character’s weapon are at Short range\. Ballistic Skill tests made to attack targets at Short range gain a \+10 bonus\. 

## Size 

Size is an important factor when attacking foes because it is usually easier to hit a larger target\. All characters and creatures have a defined Size trait, and it should be relatively easy as well for the GM to assign an appropriate Size trait to objects as needed\. Use Size Table for determining bonuses and penalties based on a target’s Size trait\. 

## Stunned Targets 

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill tests to attack Stunned targets gain a \+20 bonus\.

## Unaware Targets 

When a character has no idea that he about to be attacked, he is considered an Unaware Target\. Usually, this happens at the beginning of a combat when one or more characters are Surprised\. Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill tests made to attack Unaware targets gain a \+30 bonus\. 

## Weather and Unnatural Conditions 

Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill tests made to attack whilst enduring harsh weather or unnatural conditions, such as heavy rain, an ash storm, or standing knee\-deep in waves of fungus, suffer a –20 penalty unless stated otherwise for that situation\.
