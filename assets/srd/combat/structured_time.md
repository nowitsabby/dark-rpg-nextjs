# Structured Time

Combat takes place in structured time, as opposed to narrative time, which covers situations where time and the precise order of actions is less of a factor. Narrative time presents an abstracted version approach to situations, suitable when time can flow for days or even weeks such as travel across worlds or between stars. This aspect of the game is covered in Narrative Tools, while game play during the heat of conflict or whenever a moment's decision can decide life or death is presented here.

## Combat Encounters 

In combat or during other time\-sensitive tasks, every second counts, and the order in which things happen is crucial. To help maintain order in the chaos of battle and other events where time is of the essence, a combat encounter is broken down into rounds, turns, and actions.

### Rounds 

A round consists of each character in the encounter taking one turn. Although the characters take their turns in an order in the game system, it is assumed that they are all acting more or less simultaneously in the game world. Each round represents roughly five seconds, regardless of how many characters are involved. 

### Turns 

Each character in an encounter gets one turn each round, during which she can perform one or more actions. While characters' turns actually overlap each other slightly, turns are resolved in a specific order known as Initiative order. 

### Actions 

A character can perform one or more actions during her turn. Actions represent tasks the character might want to undertake, from moving down a corridor or into cover, to firing her gun at the enemy. When performing multiple actions, the character can execute them in any order she chooses.

## Combat Overview 

Combat is usually resolved using structured time divided into rounds, turn, and actions. Each character \(including NPCs\), takes one turn each round. Although the action during combat is happening nearly simultaneously in the game world, the different turns during a round are taken in a specific order to keep things organized. The order of these turns is determined by Initiative at the beginning of a combat encounter. 

When a new combat begins, follow these steps to determine what happens: 

### Step 1: Surprise 

At the beginning of a combat, the GM determines whether any characters are Surprised. This can only happen once, at the beginning of a combat, and there will be many combats wherein nobody is Surprised. During the first round of combat, a Surprised character loses her turn and cannot use Reactions because she has been caught unawares by her enemies. If no one is Surprised, move immediately to the next step. 

### Step 2: Set the Scene 

Before the characters can begin taking their turns, the players need to be aware of everything going on in the scene. The Game Master outlines the scenario \(or at least the parts that the characters can observe\): the combatants they face, the relative positions of everyone involved in the combat, and their surrounding environment. 

### Step 3: Determine Initiative 

To determine the order in which the characters take their turns during each round, each character involved in the combat makes an Initiative roll. The GM rolls for all Non\-Player Characters. 

### Step 4: Combatants Take Turns 

Starting with the character at the top of the Initiative order, each character takes a turn. The character currently taking her turn is known as the active character, and can perform one or more actions. Once her actions have been resolved, her turn ends and any lingering effects that specify a duration of “until the end of the player's turn” now end. The next character in the Initiative order then becomes the active character and takes her turn, and so forth. 

### Step 5: Round Ends 

Once each character has taken a turn, the round is over. Any lingering effects that specify a duration of “until the end of the round” now end. 

### Step 6: Encounter Ends 

Continue to repeat Steps 4 and 5 until the combat is finished, or until the non\-combat event \(the discovery of an explosive ready to detonate, for example\) that triggered the switch into structured time is resolved.

## Initiative

Initiative is rolled once at the beginning of each combat encounter, and determines the order in which all characters take turns each round during that encounter. To determine the Initiative order, each character rolls 1d10 and adds her Agility bonus to the result. The GM rolls Initiative for all NPCs involved in the encounter. To keep things simple, it is recommended that the GM make one Initiative roll for each group of similar enemy characters. 

After each character has determined her Initiative, the GM makes a list, placing them in order from highest to lowest. This list is known as the Initiative order, which is the order in which characters take turns each round, until the end of the combat. 

If more than one character has the same Initiative score, the one with the higher Agility characteristic is placed higher in the Initiative order. If they also have the same Agility characteristic, they both roll 1d10, and the character with the higher roll is placed higher in the Initiative order. 

Once the Initiative order has been established, it usually remains the same from round to round. If new combatants join in the middle of the fight, simply determine their Initiatives normally and insert them into the Initiative order. The GM can choose to re\-establish the Initiative order during an encounter if the events of the story demand it, and this can involve additional Surprised rounds. Generally speaking though, events such as this should be rare, and should be used to heighten tension and introduce unique or interesting new elements to the combat, rather than just when more enemy forces show up

## Surprise 

When a combat begins, some of the characters involved might be unaware of their opponents' presence or hostile intentions. Usually, a character is allowed an Awareness skill test to attempt to avoid this. There are some situations, however, where almost any character would be hard\-pressed to see the threat coming. Examples of this include: 

- Heavy rainstorms, nearby artillery barrages, void\-ship launchings, and other sustained durations of loud noises. 
- Carefully constructed ambushes \(gained from successful Stealth tests to sneak up on the Players, or Concealment skills that were used to hide attackers from easy view\).
- Settings that cause the Players to let their guard down, such as a governor's reception or Ministorum service. 
- A sudden appearance of torch\-wielding fanatics, mass hysteria in a crowded hab tavern, or other distracting events. 

If there is at least one Surprised combatant, the first round of combat is referred to as a Surprised round. During a Surprised round, all combatants roll for Initiative as normal, but any Surprised combatants lose their turn during the Surprised round. All the non\-Surprised combatants take actions using the standard Initiative order. The Surprised combatant \(or group of combatants\) can do nothing except remain in whatever state they were when combat started \(which in most cases means they simply stand still\) either because they are in shock or because they are simply unaware that they are under attack. Surprised combatants cannot use Reactions during a Surprised round. Furthermore, a non\-Surprised attacker receives a \+30 bonus to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill tests made to attack a Surprised target. After the Surprised round completely resolves, all Surprised characters recover their wits and can act normally, joining the Initiative order at whatever place they rolled at the start of the Surprised round.
