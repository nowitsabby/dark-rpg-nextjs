# Integrated Weapons

Rare and scarcely understood by the forces of the Imperial Guard, the integrated weapons wielded by the mysterious Crimson Guard give these red-robed warriors a distinct advantage over standard wargear. Part weapon system and part cybernetic implant, the user's potentia coil powers the weapon, giving it a near-endless amount of energy to draw from. This removes the usual logistical problems most Guard regiments encounter. Rarely seen on the Spinward Front, these arcane weapons have left a fearsome impression on those Guardsmen lucky enough to have served the Crimson Guard.

## Integrated Weapons Rules

Integrated Weapons link to and draw power from the potentia coil (see the Mechanicus Implants Trait), and as such only those that possess this implant may use this type of weapon. Whenever an integrated weapon would suffer a Jam the user instead takes 1 Level of Fatigue as the drain on their own potentia coil starts to wear them down.

Integrated weapons are always physically linked to their user, and cannot be dropped or discarded without first being disconnected. Disconnecting and reconnecting requires an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test and is a Half Action with the Concentration Subtype.

To use integrated weapons, a character must have Exotic Weapon Training (Integrated Weapons), in addition to any other Weapon Training talents for the base weapon's group.

### Creating Integrated Weapons

In addition to the effects listed above, certain kinds of weapons gain additional benefits when made into Integrated Weapons, as detailed below:

- Integrated las weapons have unlimited ammunition and never need to reload.
- Integrated flame, plasma, and melta weapons double their standard Clip Size. Additionally, integrated plasma weapons can still Overheat, but lose the Recharge Quality as long as they remain connected.
- Integrated chain weapons gain the Razor Sharp Quality.
- Integrated shock weapons inflict an additional --30 Penalty on Toughness Tests to resist their effects.
- Integrated power weapons increase their Damage and Penetration by +2.

Upgrading a weapon to an integrated weapon follows the standard rules for weapon upgrades except that the character attempting to upgrade the weapon must have the Forbidden Lore (Adeptus Mechanicus) Skill before she can attempt the Test. The components required to create Integrated Weapons are typically only available on Forge Worlds.

### Disconnected Integrated Weapons

Whenever an integrated weapon is disconnected it quickly loses the benefits of its power source. The weapon retains a residual charge, but this quickly fades. Ranged integrated weapons gain a clip size of 1d10+4, and once the remaining shots have been fired it cannot be fired again until it has been reconnected. Disconnected integrated weapons can Jam, and if this occurs they lose all their remaining ammunition immediately. Integrated melee weapons lose all power within 1d5+3 rounds and revert to a low-tech weapon of the same type (eg. an Integrated power sword will be treated as a standard sword once its power has drained). Integrated weapons only regain their special benefits once reconnected.

### Reconnecting Integrated Weapons

Once a disconnected integrated weapon has been reconnected to a potentia coil it regains all its usual benefits. If an integrated weapon cannot be reconnected it can be manually charged if the character has access to an external power source. This requires a Hard (--20) Tech Use Test, and grants an integrated ranged weapon an additional 1d10+4 shots or gives an integrated melee weapon 1d5+3 additional rounds of power before they cease operating again. If the character attempting the Tech-Use Test fails by two or more Degrees of Failure, the attempt has damaged the weapon, rendering it useless.
