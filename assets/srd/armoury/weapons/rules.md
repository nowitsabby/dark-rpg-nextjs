# Weapons

Weapons are divided into several groups covering a plethora of ranged weapons, dealing with everything from crossbows to plasma cannons, and melee weapons covering all manner of close combat weaponry. Unless they are of Poor craftsmanship, all weapons come with the appropriate holster or carrying strap as part of their cost.

All weapons have a profile that is presented using the following statistics, providing players and GMs with all the relevant information needed to use them:

- Name: What the weapon is called.
- Class: Describes the weapon class: Melee, Thrown, Pistol, Basic, Heavy, or Vehicle.
  - Melee: These weapons can be used in close combat. When using a Melee weapon, the wielder adds her Strength bonus (SB) to the damage inflicted.
  - Thrown: Propelled by muscle power alone, these weapons include knives, axes, spears, and the like. Unless they are also classed as Melee, they cannot be used in close combat (or if they are, they count as Improvised weapons). When using a Thrown weapon, the wielder adds her SB to the damage inflicted (with the exception of explosives such as grenades).
  - Pistol: These weapons are fired one-handed and can be used in close combat. However, when a Pistol weapon is used in close combat, the firer gains no bonuses or penalties to hit for range or targeting equipment. Pistols with the Scatter quality fired in melee are considered to be firing at Point-Blank range, but do not gain a +30 bonus for being at Point-Blank range.
  - Basic: Weapons of this class normally require two hands, but can be used one-handed with a –20 penalty to hit.
  - Heavy: Such weapons always require two hands and must be braced in some way, usually either on a bipod or tripod, to be fired without penalty. Equally, bracing could be done using a windowsill or sandbag (or the firer's shoulder in the case of missile launchers). Firing a Heavy weapon without bracing incurs a –30 penalty to hit and prohibits Semi-Auto and Full Auto Burst actions.
  - Mounted: Mounted weapons are heavy weapons too large and powerful to be man-portable. They require the Weapon Training (Heavy) Talent, just like a normal Heavy Weapon, but must be mounted on a weapons platform (such as Terminator armour) or a vehicle. Some Melee weapons (such as the Chainfist) are also in this category.
  - Vehicle: These weapons must be mounted either upon a vehicle or as part of a permanent emplacement, and are far too huge to be man-portable. Their complex ammunition feeds, massive scale, and powerful recoil require large support elements, and are therefore often mounted upon a turret. Range: This number is used to determine how far the weapon can be accurately fired in metres. Weapons can also be fired at Short, Long, and Extreme ranges, as described in Combat Circumstances. Weapons cannot be fired at targets more than four times their range distance away.
- RoF (Rate of Fire): This indicates whether the weapon can be fired either on Semi-Auto or Full Auto, and how many rounds or charges it expends when doing so. A weapon's RoF has three entries to indicate the weapon's firing modes. The first entry indicates whether the weapon can be fired singly (with an S). The second entry indicates whether a weapon can be fired semi-automatically; the number listed describes the number of shots fired when the weapon is used in this manner. Finally, the third entry describes whether the weapon can be fired on full automatic, and how many shots are fired when this happens. Any mode in which the weapon cannot be fired is indicated with a "–" mark. Some weapons can be fired in more than one mode. If this is the case, each of its different rates of fire is listed in its profile. Characters must choose which mode they are firing their weapon in before making an attack.
- Dam (Damage): The damage that a hit from the weapon deals, and the type of damage it inflicts for the purpose of Critical damage:
  - E (Energy): Using electromagnetic energies, photon blasts, or even arcane power fields, these weapons burn and scar with horrible effect.
  - I (Impact): Blunt force, brute explosions, and concussive strength mark these devices.
  - R (Rending): Weapons of this type slice and cut with razor-sharp edges or use whirring chain-teeth to lacerate flesh.
  - X (Explosive): These items rely on devastating eruptions of energy or metal to blast apart targets.
- Pen (Penetration): Penetration reflects how good the weapon is at cutting through armour. When a shot or blow hits a target, that hit ignores a number of Armour points on that Hit Location equal to the weapon's penetration value. If this ignores more Armour points than the Hit Location possesses, the hit ignores all Armour and the additional penetration has no effect. For example, if a weapon with a penetration of 3 hits a target with 5 Armour points, the target only counts as having 2 Armour points against any damage the hit causes. Note that penetration has no effect on force fields, but it does affect cover.
- Clip: How many rounds/charges the weapon holds when it is fully loaded. Should a weapon ever fire more shots than it has remaining ammunition in its loaded clip (for example, from a Full Auto Burst), the excess shots are disregarded.
- Rld (Reload): How many actions the weapon takes to reload. This is generally Half (for a Half Action) or Full (for a Full Action). Some weapons can take a number of actions over several rounds (an Extended action). The number of rounds is given as a number, for example 2 Full means that reloading takes 2 Full rounds.
- Special: Any special qualities the weapon might have, such as creating a blast when fired or needing to recharge between shots, are listed here.
- Wt (Weight): This represents how much the weapon weighs. Unless stated otherwise, this is measured in kg (kilograms).
- Availability: This identifies the standard difficulty for acquiring the item, and is used when an Acolyte makes a Requisition test. Note that the GM can modify this as needed based on local conditions or other factors.

### Weapon Jams

Weapons can jam through extreme age, maltreatment of their machine spirit, or just plain poor design. An unmodified result of 96–100 on a Ranged attack indicates the weapon has jammed. This means the attack automatically misses, and the weapon cannot be fired until the jam is cleared. Clearing a jam is a Full Action that requires a Ballistic Skill test. If the character attempting to clear the jam succeeds on the test, then the jam has been cleared, though the weapon needs to be reloaded and any ammo in it is lost. If she fails on the test, the weapon is still jammed, though she can attempt to clear it again next round. Some weapons, such as plasma guns, grenades, and missiles, carry extra risks associated with jamming. For these weapons, refer to their descriptions and weapon special qualities (see Chapter V: Armoury). Semi-automatic and fully automatic fire also increases the likelihood of jamming; this is described within the Semi-Auto Burst, Full Auto Burst, and Suppressing Fire actions.

### Weapons and Talents

Weapons require a talent to be used effectively, as without sufficient training they can prove as dangerous to friend as to foe. Each weapon type (Las, Chain, Low-Tech, etc.) requires the appropriate Weapon Training talent for best use. For example, firing a Boltgun or any other Bolt Weapon would require Weapon Training (Bolt). Exotic Weapons are more specialised, and a user must have a distinct type of Weapon Training specific to the individual Exotic weapon. There are always circumstances when a character needs to use a weapon for which she does not have the appropriate talent, though, and doing so imposes a –20 untrained penalty on the relevant test.

### Throwing Grenades

Throwing grenades requires no special training or talents, and is resolved using a Ballistic Skill test including any modifiers (such as range). On a miss, the thrown grenade lands instead in a random direction using the Scatter Diagram.

#### Fumbling Grenades and Duds

Whenever a jam results from throwing a grenade or firing a grenade launcher or similar weapon (see the Weapon Jams), something unfortunate has happened. Roll 1d10; on any result other than 10, the explosive is simply a dud and nothing happens. On a 10, the explosive detonates immediately with the effect centred on the attacker. If the explosive was fired from a launcher, it detonates in the barrel, halving its normal effect as well as destroying the weapon.

## Weapon Modifications

Even with the untold billions that exist, each weapon becomes as unique as its owner in time. Some wielders might specifically acquire a specially modified weapon, or customise their own to better match their fighting style. Such changes can alter its precision, the damage it inflicts, and other factors to make it and its user even more valued servants of the Emperor. Modifications can be made when first acquiring a weapon, or later a character (or an ally) can try to apply them himself (see Applying Personal Modifications). A weapon can have a total of four modifications, only one of which can be a sight. Note that the GM has final say over which modifications can be applied; a sniper rifle, for example, could be too unwieldy for a pistol grip.

### Applying Personal Modifications

Some characters may wish to apply their weapon modifications personally. If a character decides to do this, she gains a +30 bonus to the modification's Availability when making the requisition test to acquire it. If she succeeds the test, the modification is not applied to her weapon but instead, she receives all of the parts necessary to apply the modification himself. Once a character has the parts for a weapon modification, she can use the Trade (Armourer) skill to apply that modification to the desired weapon. This test receives a modifier equal to the Availability of the customisation being applied. If the test succeeds, the modification is successfully applied. If the test fails, the modification is not applied, and the parts necessary to apply the modification are lost in the process. Characters who suffer two or more degrees of failure damage their weapon, and it becomes Unreliable. If the weapon was previously Reliable, it instead loses that quality.

#### Removing and Re-Using Modifications

A character can also recover the parts necessary to apply a modification by removing that modification from a different weapon. To do this, the character makes a Trade (Armourer) test with a modifier equal to the Availability of the customisation being removed. If the test succeeds, the modification is successfully removed with its parts intact. If the test fails, the modification is removed, but the parts necessary to reapply the modification are lost in the process.

# Weapon Qualities
| Quality | Effect |
|---|---|
| Accurate | The weapon is crafted for precision attacks, with perfectly crafted las-lenses or finely honed barrels. This grants an additional bonus of +10 to the firer's Ballistic Skill when used with an Aim action, in addition to the normal bonus granted from Aiming. When a character fires a single shot from a single Basic weapon with the Accurate quality while benefitting from the Aim action, the attack inflicts an additional 1d10 damage for every two degrees of success beyond the first (to a maximum of an extra 2d10). These extra d10s cannot generate Righteous Fury. |
| Balanced | Carefully weighted, the weapon moves naturally with the user, making her parries more successful. Balanced weapons grant a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill tests made to Parry. Even if the wielder is using multiple Balanced weapons, she only gains the bonus once. |
| Blast (X) | Attacks from this weapon explode on impact, hurling debris and shrapnel in all directions. When working out a hit from a Blast weapon, anyone within the weapon's blast radius in metres, indicated by the number in parentheses, is also suffers a single hit from the weapon. Roll damage once and apply it to each character affected by the blast. A Blast weapon also scatters when the user fails her Ballistic Skill test when firing it . |
| Concussive (X) | Concussive weapons strike with a powerful impact strong enough to temporarily knock a foe senseless. When a target is struck by a Concussive weapon, she must take a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X). For example, a weapon with Concussive (2) would impose a –20 on this Toughness test and Concussive (0) would cause a test with no penalty. If she fails, the target is Stunned for 1 round per degree of failure. If the attack also inflicted an amount of damage greater than the target's Strength bonus, the target is knocked Prone. |
| Corrosive | These weapons utilise highly caustic acids which cause damage to both the target and her equipment. If a target is struck by an attack from a Corrosive weapon, the Armour points of any armour worn by the target in that location are reduced by 1d10 points. If the Armour points of the armour are reduced below 0 or the target is not wearing any armour in that location, the excess amount of Armour point damage (or the whole amount if the target is wearing no armour in that location) is dealt to the target. This excess damage is not reduced by Toughness. A target's armour can be reduced multiple times by the effects of a Corrosive weapon, and the Armour point damage is cumulative. A suit of armour can be repaired with a successful Challenging (+0) Tech-Use test, and an Acolyte who possesses the Armour Monger talent can repair the armour while making use of that talent. |
| Crippling (X) | Designed for cruelty and viciousness, crippling devices are favorites amongst those who prize pain and suffering. When a target suffers at least one wound from this weapon, she is considered Crippled for the remainder of the encounter or until healed of all damage. If a Crippled character takes more than a Half Action on her turn, she suffers Rending damage equal to the number in parentheses (X) to the Hit Location that suffered the original damage. This damage is not reduced by Armour or Toughness. |
| Daemonbane | Some weapons receive blessings that give them a level of power against the minions of the Dark Gods, but there are special Ordo Malleus rites that go beyond mere sanctification. When used against targets with the Daemonic trait, weapons with this quality gain the Vengeful (8) quality and their damage is not reduced by the target's Toughness bonus. |
| Defensive | A Defensive weapon, such as a shield, is intended to be used to block attacks and is awkward when used to attack. A weapon with this quality grants a +15 bonus to tests made when used to Parry, but imposes a –10 penalty on tests to make attacks with it. |
| Decay (X) | Any living creature that suffers Critical Damage (including Damage from Righteous Fury) from this weapon must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test with penalty equal to 10 times X or perish as it collapses into an amorphous puddle of sludge. |
| Devastating (X) | If the target is a horde, a successful hit from this weapon reduces the Horde's Magnitude by an additional amount equal to X. |
| Fast | The size and speed of this weapon makes it hard to Parry. Opponents that would Parry an attack against a weapon with the Fast quality take a –20 penalty on their tests |
| Felling (X) | Felling weapons make a mockery of even the most resilient enemies, cutting dense tissue and bone with ease. When calculating damage from Felling weapons, reduce the target's Unnatural Toughness bonus by the number in parentheses (X). Felling only reduces Unnatural Toughness, not the target's base Toughness bonus, and does not persist once the damage has been calculated. |
| Flame | Using materials such as promethium and incendiary powders, this weapon ignites with primordial fire. Whenever a target is struck by an attack with this quality (even if she suffers no damage), she must make an Agility test or be set on fire. If the target of the Flame attack is a vehicle, the pilot must make the appropriate Operate skill test with a bonus equal to the vehicle's Armour value on the facing hit by the Flame attack. If the pilot fails, the vehicle immediately catches fire (see On Fire! in combat). |
| Flexible |  These are often made of linked metal, rope, or other non-rigid materials that deny defensive counters. They cannot be Parried, though they themselves can be used to Parry an opponent's weapon. |
| Force | A force weapon relies on the user's mind to unlock its true potential, suddenly turning a sword or staff into a device burning with eldritch energies able to reave tanks. Force weapons count as Best craftsmanship Mono variants of the equivalent Low-Tech weapon. In the hands of a psyker, the weapon also deals bonus damage and gains bonus penetration equal to the psyker's base psy rating (so a psy rating 3 would grant +3 damage and +3 penetration), and the damage type changes to Energy. In addition, whenever a psyker damages an opponent, she may take a Focus Power action (Opposed with Willpower) as a Half Action. If she wins the test, then for every degree of success, the Force weapon's wielder deals an additional 1d10 Energy damage, ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus. Psykers always use their base psy rating when determining psychic strength for this test, and cannot generate Psychic Phenomena on this test. Force weapons cannot be destroyed by weapons with the Power Field quality. |
| Graviton | Graviton weapons alter the target's local gravity field, transforming protective armour into crushing force. When a weapon with the Graviton quality hits a target, it inflicts additional damage equal to the target's Armour points on the struck location. If the target is a vehicle or cover, it instead inflicts additional damage equal to the Armour points of the facing that the attack struck. Vehicles that suffer Critical damage from Graviton weapons always roll on the Motive Systems Critical Effects table, no matter what location was actually hit. |
| Gyro-stabilised | A Gyro-Stabilised weapon never counts its target as being farther than Long Range (normal maximum range still applies). Heavy weapons with this Quality reduce the penalty for firing without Bracing to –20. |
| Hallucinogenic (X) | Where most weapons seek to harm the body, those with this quality seek to damage the mind with exotic chemicals and neurotoxic drugs. When a creature is struck by a weapon with the Hallucinogenic quality, it must make a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or suffer a temporary delusion and roll 1d10 on Table: Hallucinogenic Effects. Respirators and sealed armour provide a +20 bonus to this test. The effects last for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every degree of failure. |
| Haywire (X) | A foul affront to the Omnissiah in the eyes of many Tech-Priests, devices with this quality seek to cripple machine spirits and make metal as weak as flesh. Everything within the field's radius, indicated by the number in parentheses, is affected. Haywire (3), for example, would affect an area with a three metre radius. Roll 1d10 on Table: Haywire Field Effects (adding any modifiers from the weapon) to determine the strength of the effect. As the field slowly dissipates, the strength lessens one step in severity each round until it becomes Insignificant (i.e., a result of Major Disruption would become Minor Disruption the following round and then cease to have an effect the round after that). Additional Haywire attacks in the same area do not stack but instead create a new effect that is either ignored if lower than the current effect or replaces the old one if higher. |
| Inaccurate | Poorly manufactured with often shoddy construction, inaccurate weapons are common in underhive gangs and heretical cults. A character gains no benefit from the Aim action when attacking with a weapon with this quality. |
| Indirect (X) | Many weapons are designed to be fired in high arcs at unseen foes or thrown from protective cover at charging enemies. Indirect weapons do not require line of sight to their target, but the attacker must still be aware of her intended target's location, either through last known position, use of a spotter, or other means. When making any ranged attack action (Standard Attack, Semi-Auto Burst, or Full Auto Burst) with an Indirect weapon, the attack does not have to target a location in line of sight of the active player, but is made at a –10 penalty and requires a Full Action instead of the normal Half Action. The GM makes the final determination on whether the character is aware of her target's location, and can add penalties to this ranged attack based on how aware the character is of her target. For each hit the ranged attack inflicts, roll once on the Scatter Diagram. The hit instead strikes the ground at a location a number of metres away from the intended target, in the direction rolled on the Scatter Diagram, equal to 1d10 minus the firer's Ballistic Skill bonus (to a minimum of zero). If the ranged attack fails, or if the Semi-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst actions fail to achieve the maximum potential hits, the remaining missed hits—up to the maximum potential hits for the rate of fire used in the attack—are still fired, but miss their target. For each missed hit, roll once on the Scatter Diagram. The hit instead strikes the ground at a location Xd10 metres away from the intended target in the direction rolled on the Scatter Diagram, where X is equal to the number in parentheses (X). |
| Irradiated (X) | When a character is struck by an attack from this weapon (whether or not she suffers Damage) she must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test with penalty equal to 10 times X or suffer 2d10 Toughness Damage. |
| Lance | Lance weapons focus devastating energy, piercing armour with ease. Weapons with this quality have a variable penetration value that is dependent on the accuracy of each shot. When a target is hit by a weapon with the Lance quality, increase the weapon's penetration value by its base value once for each degree of success the attacker achieves. For example, if a Lance weapon had a base penetration value of 5 and hit with three degrees of success (adding 3x5=15), the total penetration for the attack would be 20. |
| Maximal | Many energy weapons have multiple settings, allowing the user greater tactical flexibility in combat. As a Free Action, this weapon can be switched between two modes: Standard (which uses the normal weapon profile) and Maximal. When the weapon is fired on Maximal, it adds 10 metres to its range, 1d10 to its damage, and +2 to its penetration. If it has the Blast quality, then the value of this quality is increased by 2 (i.e., Blast [3] becomes Blast [5]). The weapon also uses three times the normal amount of ammunition per shot and gains the Recharge quality |
| Melta | These weapons rely on intense heat to negate protective armour, turning even the thickest to steaming liquid. This weapon doubles its penetration when firing at Short range or closer. |
| Ogryn-Proof | The bestial Ogryn that serve amongst the ranks of the Imperial Guard have hands that are not only much larger than those of a normal human, but also far stronger. Most Ogryn have a hard time using them to perform delicate, or even normal, tasks. There are many weapons, however, that are perfect for use by these cumbersome creatures. Characters with the Clumsy Trait can use any weapon with the Ogryn-Proof Quality with no penalty. |
| Overcharge | A weapon with this Quality may expend three times the regular ammunition usage to gain the Concussive (2), Devastating (2), Overheats (on a roll of 86 or higher instead of 91), and Recharge Qualities. If the weapon already has either the Concussive or Devastating Qualities, then add the two together (eg. a Devastating [3] weapon becomes Devastating [5]). |
| Overheats | Through inefficient shielding, defective venting, or simply inherent design, the weapon often becomes overcome with the heat of its ammunition or firing methods. On an attack roll of 91 or higher, this weapon overheats. The wielder suffers Energy damage equal to the weapon's damage with a penetration of 0 to an arm location (the arm holding the weapon if the weapon was fired one-handed, or a random arm if the weapon was fired with two hands). The wielder may choose to avoid taking the damage by dropping the weapon as a Free Action. A weapon that overheats must spend the round afterwards cooling down, and cannot be fired again until the second round after overheating. A weapon with this quality does not jam, and any effect that would cause the weapon to jam instead causes the weapon to overheat. |
| Power field | Power fields form a cloud of disruptive energy, allowing a weapon to strike with terrible force. When the character successfully uses this weapon to Parry an attack made with a weapon that lacks this quality, roll 1d100;  on a result of 26 or higher, she destroys the attacker's weapon. Weapons with the Warp Weapon or Force quality, and Natural Weapons, are immune to this effect. |
| Primitive (X) | Crude and basic in design, these kinds of weapons, while still deadly, are less effective against modern armour. When rolling for damage with these weapons, any die result greater than the number in parentheses (X) counts as that number instead. For example, a weapon with Primitive (7) would count all damage rolls of 8, 9 or 10 as 7. These weapons can still generate Righteous Fury  as normal, on a damage roll of 10. |
| Proven (X) | These weapons always inflict massive trauma. When rolling for damage with these weapons, any die result lower than the number in parentheses (X) counts as that number instead. Thus, a Proven (3) weapon would treat any die result of 1 or 2 as a 3 for the purposes of calculating damage. |
| Razor Sharp | Certain weapons or ammunition types have the ability to slice right through armour if they hit just right. If the wielder scores three or more degrees of success when attacking with this weapon, the weapon's penetration value is doubled when resolving any hits from that attack. |
| Recharge | Some weapons lack continuous power or ammunition supplies, and each strike drains capacitors or empties fuel reservoirs. When a weapon with this quality is used to make an attack, that weapon cannot be used to attack again until the end of the next round (in effect, it can only be used once every other round). |
| Reliable | Using ancient and well-consecrated designs, reliable weapons bring glory to the Omnissiah with each attack. Reliable weapons only jam on an unmodified result of 100. Reliable weapons with the Spray quality, or which do not make hit rolls, never jam. |
| Sanctified | These weapons are blessed against the forces of Chaos. Any damage inflicted by a Sanctified weapon counts as Holy damage, which can have unique effects against some terrible Daemons and other denizens of the Warp. |
| Scatter | The standard ammunition of these weapons spreads out when fired, ripping apart targets at close range but inflicting considerably less harm from afar. When fired at Point Blank range, this weapon gains +10 to hit and deals +3 damage. When fired at Short range, it gains +10 to hit. At any longer ranges, it suffers –3 damage. |
| Shocking | Shocking weapons can incapacitate their opponents with a powerful surge of energy or other non-lethal means. A target that takes at least 1 point of damage from a Shocking weapon (after Armour and Toughness bonus) must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness test. If she fails, she suffers 1 level of Fatigue and is Stunned for a number of rounds equal to half of her degrees of failure (rounding up). |
| Smoke (X) | Rather than inflicting damage, these weapons throw up dense clouds to create cover. When a hit is scored from a weapon with this quality, it creates a smokescreen at the point of impact with a radius in metres equal to the number in parentheses (X). This screen lasts for 1d10+10 rounds, or a shorter time in adverse weather conditions (see the effects of smoke). |
| Snare (X) | These ensnaring devices use masses of fibrous webbing, adhesive fluids, and other entangling materials to bring an enemy down. When a target is struck by a weapon with this quality, it must make an Agility test with a penalty equal ten times the number in parentheses (X) or be Immobilised. For example, a weapon with Snare (1) would impose a –10 penalty on this test. An Immobilised target can attempt no actions other than trying to escape the bonds. As a Full Action, she can make a Challenging (+0) Strength or Agility test, with a penalty equal to ten times the number in parentheses (X). If she succeeds, she bursts free or wriggles out. The target is considered Helpless  until she escapes. |
| Spray | Spray weapons use large area-effect shots to strike more foes, sacrificing range for wider coverage. Unlike other weapons,they have just one range and, when fired, hit all those in their area of effect. The wielder does not need to test Ballistic Skill.  All creatures in the weapon's path (a cone-shaped area extending in a 30° arc from the firer out to the weapon's range) must make a Challenging (+0) Agility test or suffer one hit from the weapon. If the wielder does not possess the appropriate Weapon Training talent, targets gain a +20 bonus on the test;  this rises to +30 if the weapon is Heavy and the wielder is not braced. Cover does not protect from Spray attacks unless it completely conceals a target. Because there is no attack roll, they are always considered to strike the Body location. They jam if the firer rolls a 9 on any damage dice (before any modifiers are applied). Due to the inaccurate nature of their design, they cannot be used to make Called Shot actions. |
| Storm | Firing with a hail of shots, these weapons strike so rapidly that enemies are filled with metal in an instant. This quality doubles the number of hits the weapon inflicts on the target and the amount of ammunition expended. For example, when firing a weapon with the Storm quality in fully automatic mode, each degree of success yields two additional hits (up to the weapon's firing rate, as normal) |
| Tainted | Permeated with the power of the Warp, these weapons draw out the inner darkness of their wielders. Weapons with this quality inflict additional damage equal to the value of the user's Corruption bonus or Daemonic (X) trait value (whichever is higher). |
| Tearing | These weapons call on spinning chainblades, serrated claws, burrowing projectiles, and other vicious means to rip apart targets. These weapons roll one extra die for damage, and the lowest result is discarded. |
| Toxic (X) | Filled with malignant chemicals and fast acting poisons, toxic weapons bring down enemies through virulence and sickness. At the end of her turn, if a character has suffered damage (after Armour and Toughness bonus) in the last round from a weapon with this quality, she must make a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or suffer 1d10 additional damage (of the same type as the first weapon with this quality to damage her that round). For example, a weapon with Toxic (4) imposes a –40 on the tests to resist its effects. Some weapons or creatures carry additional effects with their toxins or inflict more damage, as indicated in their individual descriptions. |
| Twin-Linked | A Twin-Linked weapon represents two identical weapons connected together and set to fire at the same time, increasing the chances of scoring a hit by blasting more shots at the target. A weapon with this quality gains a +20 to hit when fired and uses twice as much ammunition. In addition, the weapon scores one additional hit if the attack roll succeeds by two or more degrees of success. When emptied, the weapon's reload time is doubled. |
| Unbalanced | Cumbersome, awkward to use, and often heavy, these are usually powerful offensively, but suffer in defence actions such as parrying. These weapons cannot be used to make Lighting Attack actions, and impose a –10 penalty when used to Parry. |
| Unreliable | A clear affront to the Omnissiah, Unreliable devices represent poorly designed, badly manufactured, or improperly consecrated weapons that are perhaps better than no weapon at all, but not by a great measure. An Unreliable weapon suffers a jam on a roll of 91 or higher, even if fired on Semi- or Full Auto. |
| Unwieldy | Huge and often top-heavy, Unwieldy weapons are too awkward to be used with finesse. They cannot be used to Parry or make Lightning Attack actions. |
| Warp Weapon | Warp weapons ignore Armour and the AP generated from cover. Force fields and armour specially warded work normally against them. |
| Vengeful (X) | These weapons seemingly embody the Emperor's wrath, and eagerly strike down any who would stand against Her servants. When attacking with this weapon, the attacker triggers Righteous Fury on any damage die result with a value of X or higher (before any modifiers are applied). |

## Hallucinogenic Effects

| Roll | Effect | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Bugsbugsbugsbugs! | The character drops to the floor, flailing and screaming as she tries to claw off imaginary insects devouring her skin and flesh. The character gains the Prone and Stunned conditions. |
| 2 | My hands...! | The character believes her hands have turned into slimy tentacles, or perhaps the flesh has begun to strip off the bone in bloody lumps. Regardless of the particulars, the character drops everything she is carrying and spends the duration staring at her hands and screaming. The character is Stunned. |
| 3 | They're coming through the walls! | The character sees gruesome aliens bursting through the walls/ceiling/floor/bushes and opens fire. The character must spend each turn firing at a random piece of terrain within her line of sight. Any creatures caught in the line of fire are subject to attacks as normal. Each round, choose a new target at random (use the Scatter Diagram) to determine which direction that is, with a "7" meaning she shoots the ground, and a "10" meaning she fires wildly into the air. |
| 4 | Nobody can see me! | The character believes she is invisible and wanders aimlessly, making faces at those around her. She waddles about in random directions each round (use the Scatter Diagram), using a Full Action to move. The character retains her Reactions. |
| 5 | I can fly! | The sky looks so big and inviting, the character flaps her arms trying to imitate a pterasquirrel. She might do nothing but jump up and down on the spot. If she is standing above ground level, she may throw himself off in a random direction, with the usual consequences for falling—appalling injury or death being the likely outcomes. |
| 6 | They've got it in for me...! | The character is overcome with paranoia, believing even her own comrades are out to get her. On the character's turn, she must move to a position of cover, getting out of line of sight from any other characters. She remains hidden until the effect ends, moving to new cover as needed to stay as hidden as possible. |
| 7 | They got me! | The character believes that the gas is toxic and collapses to the floor as if dead;  she counts as being Helpless. Other characters who sees her "die" must pass a Challenging (+0) Intelligence test;  should they fail then they also think the character is dead. |
| 8 | I'll take you all on! | The character is filled with a burning rage and a desire for violence. The character becomes Frenzied  for the duration of the effects, and must attack the closest opponent. |
| 9 | I'm only little! | The character believes she has shrunk to half her normal size and everything else is big and frightening now. All other characters count as having the Fear (3) trait to the character. |
| 10 | The worms! | The character desperately tries to remove a massive fanged worm she thinks is slowly winding its way up her leg. If holding a gun, she shoots himself with it or, if not, she hits himself in the leg with whatever melee weapon she is holding. If the character is currently holding no weapon, she draws a random weapon from those she carries and attacks himself with it. Randomly determine which leg the character believes to be trapped by the worm. The attack automatically inflicts a single hit with 1d5 degrees of success that deals damage normally. |

## Haywire Field Effects

| Roll | Effect | Description |
| 1–2 | Insignificant | Though some machine spirits are unsettled, there is no noticeable effect on nearby technology. |
| 3–4 | Minor Disruption | All actions utilising powered technology, including firing ranged weapons without the Primitive quality, Tech-Use tests, and any physical actions attempted while wearing power armour or employing cybernetics, suffer a –10 penalty. The base movement of anyone in power armour is reduced by 1. |
| 5–6 | Major Disruption | All actions utilising technology, including firing ranged weapons without the Primitive quality, Tech-Use tests, and any physical actions attempted while wearing power armour or employing cybernetics, suffer a –20 penalty. The base movement of anyone in power armour is reduced by 3. Melee weapons with technological components function as a Primitive weapon of the analogous type. |
| 7–8 | Dead Zone | Technology within the affected area completely ceases to function. Power armour becomes unpowered, reducing the wearer's move to 1. Characters with cybernetic replacements to any internal organ(s) suffer one level of Fatigue each round they remain in the Dead Zone. Melee weapons with technological components (i.e. power swords) function as a Low-Tech weapon of their type. |
| 9–10 | Prolonged Dead Zone | As Dead Zone, but lasting for 1d5 rounds before lessening to a Major Disruption (and then dissipating as normal). |
