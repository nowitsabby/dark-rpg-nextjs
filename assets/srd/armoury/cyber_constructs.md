# Cyber-Constructs 

It is not unheard of for individuals who are not Cyber-Mastiff handlers, or who are not equipped with a Constructer Interface to make use of Cyber-Constructs. While a trained Adeptus Mechanicus agent, with the proper augmetics is vastly more capable of repairing, controlling, and training these creatures, they are not alone in their use. Anyone equipped with a Constructer Interface can program her Cyber-Construct to obey the vocal (or vox) commands of another agent. This is limited, and cogitation patterns that would normally process evasion and attack movements must instead decipher human speech and intent. To avoid confusion, many users give the beast a designation, commands may be easily addressed, so that it does not interpret random words in other discussion as an order.

It requires an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test to order a Cyber-Construct to obey the commands of another. This test requires that the user be able to physically adjust the Cyber-Construct, and takes 1 hour. Once so ordered, the creature cannot benefit from the Constructor-Interface until the process has been repeated (this includes uploaded patterns). The following vocal (or vox) commands may be given by users without a Constructor Interface:

#### Attack 

The user spends a Half-Action designating a target that both she and the construct can see. The Construct will then attack the target until it is dead (or sometimes after). Constructs are decidedly ferocious creatures that will not stop until their target is dead or they have been called to heel.

#### Tackle 

Similar to the Attack order, the Cyber-Construct will employ any non-lethal weapons it has to subdue a target. If it lacks non-lethal weapon, it will attack until the target is unconscious (and usually bleeding to death).

#### Find 

Given pertinent data (such as a spoor sample or a pict image) the construct will do it's best to track a target. It will search an area of up to 50m in an attempt to find the target, but will not leave line of sight to the user.

# Cyber-Construct Statistics

## Grapple-Hawk

Rarely used outside the Arbites, these exotic cyber-familiars take the form of elegant shining steel hawks. Their glittering crania contain the transplanted instincts of avians trained to seize moving targets without damaging them. These instincts, transferred to mechanical constructs fitted with powerful suspensors and talons capable of tearing through cast-iron, enable Arbites handlers to arrest suspects quickly (if brutally) on the streets. Designed to be carried on the hip, or to perch elsewhere on the handler's armour, the Subrique-pattern Grapple-hawk can be deployed quickly in pursuit of a criminal.

## Bullpup Cyber-Mastiff

The beast is carefully crafted as a true terror weapon, a massively built and heavily-armoured steel construct of considerable bulk. Equipped with sub-sonic voxhailers that continually emit a selection of low frequency vocalisations designed to trigger fear in the local population where they are deployed, this model finds frequent use during intense riots. Capable of shrugging off most small arms fire, and of bringing down even large groups of well-armed opponents, the Bullpups tend to be used as a final weapon to launch at their foes preventing a civil uprising from turning into a civil war. Bullpups are equipped with shock jaws which can also double as chainblade weapons. The construct also has magnetic locking feet and jaws which enable the creature to lock on to a target and hold it in place.

**Magnetic Jaw:** The Cyber-mastiff may magnetically attach itself to any metal surface and lock its jaws around an opponent. If the Bullpup Cyber-mastiff successfully hits with a bite attack, it may lock itself in position instead of dealing damage. Freeing oneself from a Bullpup's magnetic jaws requires a Hard (-20) Strength Test. If ordered to, the Bullpup may activate its chain-bite, dealing chain-bite damage to the target, and releasing it.

## Bloodhound Cyber-Mastiff

While many Cyber-mastiffs have some tracking ability, the programming and routines implanted within the Bloodhounds are trained by some of the finest handlers available in the sector. Once implanted in a light Cyber-mastiff chassis, the animal instinct and repetitive training is linked to some of the most sophisticated olfactory sensors available in the sector (and some claim the Imperium). This formidable equipment suite is combined with an insidiously effective training regimen, which electrically stimulates the cogitator's cortical centres upon completion of a successful ‘find.' This practice causes the Bloodhound to become obsessive and tireless in its duties; the creatures have been rumoured to track targets for hundreds of miles without sleep or rest, although this may be a tall tale used to intimidate criminals into submission.

## Eliminator Cyber-Mastiff

A heavily modified Cyber-Mastiff, the Eliminator has no protocols or programming for bringing down its targets alive. It simply tracks, hunts, and kills any target loaded into its sophisticated spoor-identifying protocols. Most are equipped with a pair of overcharged las-weapons in pods mounted on the shoulders, leaving the head free to mount a mouthful of reciprocating chainblades. However, some models have been modified to carry even more powerful weaponry.

**Linked Targeting:** The Eliminator-Mastiff may fire both of its shoulder mounted weapons as part of a Full Attack Action as per the Two-Weapon Wielder (Ballistic) Talent, suffering no off-hand penalties or negative modifiers for wielding two weapons.

**Replacement Weapons:** The weapons on the Eliminator Mastiff may be replaced with any Basic ranged weapons with a Difficult (-10) Tech-Use Test, subject to the GM's discretion. However, only Las weapons may benefit from the integral power source, all others must use their listed clip size.
