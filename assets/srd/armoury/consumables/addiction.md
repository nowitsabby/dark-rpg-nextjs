# Excessive Drug Use and Addiction 

When the same drug is used too often in a short period of time, there is a chance for it to have a diminished effect as the user builds up an immunity or tolerance. A character who uses more than one dose of a given drug in a 24 hour period must make an Ordinary (+10) Toughness test for each use after the first, with a cumulative -10 penalty for each additional dose. If he fails, the drug has no useful effect and further doses do nothing for the next 24 hours.

Excessive drug use can also lead to Addiction. Every time the effects of a drug indicated as Addictive wears off, the user must take a Routine (+20) Willpower test with a -5 modifier for every dose taken in the last week. Failure means the user is Addicted and will suffer one level of Fatigue unless he gets another dose within 12 hours (should this dose trigger the Excessive Drug Use test above, he must pass the test to overcome the Fatigue loss). Once per day, the character (should he so choose) can overcome the Addiction by passing Very Hard (-30) tests for both Willpower and Toughness
