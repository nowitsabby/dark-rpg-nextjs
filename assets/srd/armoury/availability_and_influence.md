# Availability and Influence

There is no standard currency across the Imperium, and even in established sectors, few respect the coinage of some far-distant world. For most, this is no matter. Very few individuals travel between worlds in the 41st Millennium; the majority of humans spend their entire existence within a few kilometres of their birthplace, as they toil and sweat for the Imperium in the countless billions. Acolytes might gain hoards of precious coins on one world, only to find them worthless on the next. They must rely instead on other means to purchase goods, request aid, and offer material assistance. This is expressed through Influence, here representing tangibles including any accumulated local wealth, but also the intangibles of debts, favours, and reputation. This can sometimes vary from world to world, depending on previous visits or the company currently kept. An Inquisitor might establish credit on a world for his Acolytes to use in equipping themselves, or (for greater covertness) they could be left to develop their own means. Despite their often excellent weapons and equipment, the nature of their duties means they are always seeking alternative gear to fit local settings, restocks of ammunition, repairs to damaged armour, and other essentials. It is through using their Influence that they garner the resources they need to accomplish their missions.

## A Dark Age of Technology

Technology is commonplace in the Imperium of the 41st Millennium, but it is mysterious and unfathomable. Most actual understanding has been lost over the ages, replaced with dogma, rote instruction, and myth. What little knowledge that remains from is the carefully guarded domain of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and has been for thousands of years. Acolytes may understand the rudiments of how their weapons and gear work, at least in principle, but more likely they know that if they mumble the correct words and make the proper motions and gestures (rubbing oil here, twisting that knob there) their equipment will work. Showing this respect for the machine spirit that dwells within a weapon is always wise, and only those who want their gun to fail in the midst of battle would ignore such observances.

## Acquiring Items

When a character wants to acquire an item or resource, he makes a Requisition test. This test represents the character using the various resources he has at his disposal, including local currencies or his fearsome reputation, to attempt to purchase, trade, or extort what he wants from his current location. It also takes into account the item's or resource's overall availability and quality.

### Availability

Every item has an Availability modifier in its profile that represents how easy or difficult the item is to acquire on an average Imperial world. This modifier is applied to any Requisition test made to attempt to acquire the item. Table Availability Modifiers lists out the Availability levels used, and the modifier each gives to the Requisition test needed to acquire the item. Note that these modifiers stack with any modifiers from craftsmanship levels or other factors that the GM decides to impose.

| Availability | Requisition Modifier |
|---|---|
| Ubiquitous | Automatic |
| Abundant | Easy (+30) |
| Plentiful | Routine (+20) |
| Common | Ordinary (+10) |
| Average | Challenging (+0) |
| Scarce | Difficult (–10) |
| Rare | Hard (–20) |
| Very Rare | Very Hard (–30) |
| Extremely Rare | Arduous (–40) |
| Near Unique | Punishing (–50) |
| Unique | Hellish (–60)/GM's discretion |

### Craftsmanship

The overall quality of a device is expressed in terms of its craftsmanship. All equipment has a craftsmanship value, classified by Poor, Common, Good, or Best craftsmanship, with Common being the default unless otherwise indicated. This value expresses the care taken when the piece of equipment was created, but also covers how well it has been maintained. A device that might have been of Good craftsmanship when it was created could degrade to Poor after years of abuse and neglect. Weapons and armour offer specific rules for their craftsmanship as outlined below. For other goods and services, their effectiveness and Availability are both modified by their craftsmanship. Because such goods are unlikely to have a frequent impact on game play, the precise effects are subject to the Game Master's judgement. As a general rule, a Poor item might fail at an inopportune time, and a Poor service could take longer to complete and fail to live up to the characters' expectations. In sharp contrast, Good or Best services are completed well within their expected deadlines and should include luxuries that exceed the characters' hopes. Similarly, a Good or Best craftsmanship item might offer unexpected features and prove reliable even under the most extreme circumstances. Players must also consider craftsmanship when acquiring an item through Requisition. The calculation for an item's Availability assumes that it is of Common craftsmanship. If the character is willing to settle for Poor craftsmanship or desires a higher quality item, the Requisition test must reflect this variation. Consult Table Craftsmanship, Requisition, and Repair and add in the appropriate modifier. Availability of alternative craftsmanship products is always subject to the Game Master's discretion. It could be that in a particular setting, the only items available fall into a particular category or range of craftsmanship.

| Craftsmanship Level | Requisition And Repair Modifier | Ranged Weapons | Melee Weapons | Armour |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1 (Poor)** | +10 | Shoddy and dangerous to use, this weapon has the Unreliable quality. If the weapon already has this quality, then it jams on any failed hit roll. | Lax craftsmanship or poorly balanced work means this weapon inflicts a –10 penalty to all Weapon Skill tests made with it. | Badly fitted, designed, or damaged, Poor armour is difficult to wear. Its Maximum Agility is lowered by 10. |
| **2 (Common)** | +0 |  |  |  |
| **3 (Good)** | –20 | This weapon is constructed well and loses the Unreliable quality. If it does not have the Unreliable quality, it gains the Reliable quality. If it already has this quality, there is no further effect beyond the obvious fine workmanship of the weapon. | An eye towards balance and design means this weapon grants a +5 bonus to all Weapon Skill tests made with it. | Well constructed and better fitting, this armour is easier to wear. The Maximum Agility for this armour is increased by 10. |
| **4 (Best)** | –30 | As fine a piece of craftsmanship as can be found, this weapon gains all the benefits of Good craftsmanship, but also never jams or overheats. | Superior materials and superb design means this weapon grants a +10 bonus to all Weapon Skill tests made with it, and increases the damage it deals by +1. | Finely wrought and perfectly fitted, Best armour is like donning a second skin. Its Maximum Agility is increased by 10 and the AP it provides to each covered location is increased by 1. |

### Damaged Items

Even the most finely wrought item is not immune to impairment, and it can become damaged. This might come from serious mistreatment, ongoing neglect, or specific effects from other items or even psychic powers. Continual use of a sniper rifle as a melee weapon, for example, could lead the GM to declare it is damaged. A damaged item cannot be used, and must be repaired (or replaced); if traded in, its damaged status imposes a –20 penalty on the subsequent Requisition test. Note that damage differs from actual weapon destruction, such as the result of a weapon's Power Field quality destroying another weapon. Destroyed items cannot be repaired.

### Repairing Items

To repair a damaged item, the character makes a Tech-Use test and applies the repair modifier from Table Craftsmanship, Requisition, and Repair that corresponds with the craftsmanship level for the item. If the test succeeds, the item is repaired and can be used again as normal. If the test fails with four or more degrees of failure, the item is destroyed and no further repair attempts are possible.

## The Requisition Test

To acquire an item or service, a character must make a Requisition test. To do so, the character makes a test and compare the result to his Influence characteristic. This test is modified by the Availability of the item being acquired, the status of the item being acquired, any items traded, as well as any modifiers decided by the GM due to location-specific conditions. If the character succeeds, he acquires the item or service. Acquired weapons come with two standard ammunition clips, plus one extra clip for every degree of success on the test beyond the first. Successful requisitions for ammo clips yield two clips, plus one extra clip for every degree of success beyond the first, while those for grenades, drugs, and other single-use items garner one item, plus one extra for every degree of success on the test beyond the first.

Each time a character makes a Requisition test to acquire an item with a negative Availability modifier, the group's Subtlety value is decreased by a number equal to the tens digit of that availability modifier. Thus, a Requisition test to acquire an item with the Scarce (–20) availability modifier decreases the group's Subtlety by 2, even if the attempt was unsuccessful. Other tests can impact Subtlety at the GM's discretion, such as in highly conspicuous settings or when dealing with infamous merchants. Each test should also take time to conduct, with the Acolyte relating what means he is using and where he is going. The GM can then apply a realistic time for the attempt to prevent the warband from spending undue time acquiring items during their investigations and adventures.

### Location Modifiers

The worlds of the Imperium are infinitely varied, and what is available on a crowded hive world can be very different from what is available on a backwater feral world. Some items might be impossible to obtain on certain worlds or locations. Lasguns, for example, are commonly used across the Imperium, but an Acolyte might not be able to find a working las power cell on a remote feral world. The GM can apply modifiers to the Requisition test based on the economy and trade network of the current location, including native creeds and technological conditions. In cases where the character is not near any source from which he could acquire the item or service, the GM can even simply disallow the Requisition test.

### Trading in Items

When attempting to obtain an item or service, any bargaining chip is helpful. When a character is making a Requisition test, he can offer up one item he has in his possession to trade in, making the test easier. The item selected to trade must have an availability lower than the item being requisitioned. For example, if the item being requisitioned has an availability of –20, the traded in item must have an availability of –30 or below.

When trading in an item this way, the character gets a bonus to his Requisition test equal to the difference between the two items' availabilities. For example, if the item being requisitioned has an availability of –10, and the item being traded in has an Availability of –30, the character gains a +20 bonus to his Requisition test.

If the Requisition test succeeds, the offered item is traded away, and lost. If the test fails, however, the item is not traded, and the character keeps it.

### "The Emperor Provides..."

A player might decide that it is in his character's best interest to focus his skills so that he is better suited for acquiring equipment. In this way, one Acolyte could be the main negotiator for obtaining unusual items for the warband, or for bartering for any extra gear. A character who chooses to develop himself in this way would likely seek to advance his Commerce skill and Fellowship characteristic. Following this path, the warband improves its odds of having access to the most appropriate gear for its investigation, and might even acquire a few luxuries along the way.

Any time that a character seeks to obtain an item, he begins by identifying the person or group most likely to provide it. Once he has done so, he can engage in a Challenging (+0) Opposed Commerce test. For every degree of success on the test, the Acolyte receives a +10 bonus to his Requisition test to obtain an item. Three or more degrees of failure, however, imposes a –10 penalty on the test and could possibly impact the warband's Subtlety.

## Upkeep Tests

Even after the Explorers have acquired an item, it may still be a drain on the resources of the dynasty—requiring fuel to run, dues to be paid, or careful maintenance and repair. At certain times (see below), the GM may require the Explorers to make an Upkeep Test to see if they lose their acquisition or it is diminished or degraded in some way. An Upkeep Test functions in the same way as an Acquisition Test, using all the same modifiers and factors involved in acquiring the original item—in effect, the Explorers are acquiring the item or resource again. If they pass the Test, then their acquisition is unaffected, otherwise they have encountered a shortfall in funds or a waning of favour or influence and must choose one of the following options:

- Discard the item or resource: The Explorers cannot use the acquisition until it is repaired, reloaded, or purchased anew. An acquisition lost in this way cannot be reacquired until the Explorers' Profit Factor increases.
- Downgrade the item or resource: The acquisition's Craftsmanship is reduced by one level (i.e., Best to Good, Good to Common, etc.). If the acquisition is already of Poor Craftsmanship, then this option may not be selected.
- Downsize the item or resource: The acquisition's Scale is reduced by one level (i.e., Major to Standard, Minor to Trivial, etc.). If the acquisition is already of Negligible Scale, then this option may not be selected.
- Overstretch Profit Factor: The Explorers incur a –5 penalty to all Acquisition Tests until either the Explorers' Profit Factor increases or they choose to discard, downgrade, or downsize the acquisition.

### When to Make an Upkeep Test

The GM can require the Explorers to make Upkeep Tests whenever they suffer a reduction in their fortunes or commit to a massive expenditure of wealth. He can also call on them to make a Test when an item is at risk of damage or destruction. Some examples of when the GM can require the Explorers to make an Upkeep Test include:

- When an acquisition is expended, damaged, or destroyed: Such as a suit of armour worn by an Explorer that suffers massive damage, a planetary settlement bombarded from orbit, or a supply of rare ammunition used excessively.
- When a rival or adversary attacks the Explorers' holdings or tries to steal their goods or retainers: Such as a mass kidnapping of crewmen on shore leave or when a treacherous adept is skimming off their profits for ship repairs, leading to the forfeiting of valuable components.
- When fate plays a hand in the Explorers' dynasty: Such as when a hired mercenary company with divided loyalties gets a better offer or there is a system-wide plague that threatens the Explorers' local promethium suppliers.

Ultimately, it is up to the GM to decide when the Explorers should make Upkeep Tests, and he should use them as a tool to both remind the PCs that their worldly possession can be tenuous and that there are often consequences for their actions.
