      "description": "If the conversion field blocks more than 12 points of damage from a single attack, the release of light is strong enough to act as a photon flash grenade burst centred on the wearer. The character wearing the conversion field is unaffected by this burst.",

Roll 3d10 for the number of metres travelledâ€”the wearer always emerges on solid footing and in a suitable empty space. If all three dice come up with the same number (e.g., 3 results of 7), then the user does not re-emerge for 1d5 rounds and gains 1 Corruption point from exposure to the unnatural energies within the Warp. If the activation is unexpected, then the wearer cannot act for one round while she regains her sense of place",

      "availability": "Very Rare",
      "description": "The wall consists of two or more generators. Activating or deactivating a generator requires a Full Action, which also activates all other linked generators. A linear force field then forms between each generator, 1.5 metres high and up to 8 metres in length. The barrier acts as cover, so only parts of the body protected by the field wall gain force field protection. If a wall section overloads, then only that portion between the two generators shuts down, and any other linked sections remain unaffected.",

When the wearer is affected directly by a psychic power, she may make her field save. If she is successful, the power has no affect on her. Of course, the field is useless against indirect attacks from psychic powers, such as dropping a large stone on the wearer from a great height using telekinetics.",
