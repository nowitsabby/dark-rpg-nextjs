# Protective Gear

## Armour

Armour provides Armour points (AP) to various locations on a character's body, which can mitigate damage. Some kinds of armour also have special properties noted in their description. Each type of armour has the following characteristics:

- Armour Type: Describes the type of armour: Basic, Flak, Mesh, Carapace, or Power.
- Location(s) Covered: What locations the armour covers, which can be a combination of arms, legs, body, and head. Some armour covers all six locations and is noted as covering "All."
- AP (Armour points): How many Armour points the armour provides for the locations covered. Any non-Best craftsmanship armour that provides 7 or more APs inflicts a –30 penalty on the wearer's Stealth tests.
- Max Ag: This is the maximum value a character wearing this armour can count his Agility: if the character's Agility is higher than this number, it counts as this number instead. If wearing multiple armour devices (such as a helmet and vest), a character uses the lowest Max Ag value.
- Weight: Represents how much the armour weighs.
- Availability: This identifies the armour's Availability, and is used when making Requisition tests to acquire it.

### Mixing Armour

Characters can wear multiple armours if desired, but the protective qualities are not additive. When an area covered by multiple pieces of armour is struck, the highest AP value is used and all other armours are ignored for purposes of determining damage.

## Armour Modifications

A suit of armour can be a second home for its wearer, and as such, many will seek to modify it to better suit their situation or style. Some might seek out a specially modified piece of armour, or perhaps customise their own. Such changes can improve its fit, or provide protection from the elements. Modifications can be made when first acquiring a piece of armour, or later a character (or an ally) can try to apply them themselves (see Applying Personal Modifications). A suit of armour can have a total of four modifications. Note that the GM has final say over which modifications can be applied; a suit of animal hides, for example, might not be the best candidate for an incense burner.

### Applying Personal Modifications

Some characters may wish to apply their armour modifications personally. If a character decides to do this, he gains a +30 bonus to the modification's Availability when making the requisition test to acquire it. If he succeeds the test, the modification is not applied to his weapon but instead, he receives all of the parts necessary to apply the modification himself. Once a character has the parts for an armour modification, he can use the Trade (Armourer) skill to apply that modification to the desired weapon. This test receives a modifier equal to the Availability of the customisation being applied. If the test succeeds, the modification is successfully applied. If the test fails, the modification is not applied, and the parts necessary to apply the modification are lost in the process. Characters who suffer two or more degrees of failure damage their weapon, and it becomes Unreliable. If the weapon was previously Reliable, it instead loses that quality.

#### Removing and Re-Using Modifications

A character can also recover the parts necessary to apply a modification by removing that modification from a different piece of armour. To do this, the character makes a Trade (Armourer) test with a modifier equal to the Availability of the customisation being removed. If the test succeeds, the modification is successfully removed with its parts intact. If the test fails, the modification is removed, but the parts necessary to reapply the modification are lost in the process.

### Power Armour Subsystems

The internal power supply, machine spirit, and bulky frames of most suits of Power Armour mean they can support upgrades and modifications that a mundane suit of carapace or flak could not. These upgrades, known as subsystems, do not count against the maximum number of upgrades the armour can support.

## Force Fields

While physical armour is often as effective as it is impressive (sometimes merely the sight of a heavily armoured Acolyte is enough to quell a would-be heresy), there are other times where a stealthy approach is required, or the situation calls for a less combative presence. Force fields can provide protection in these instances, as they are usually more concealable and often much more effective as well. Most are small, otherwise unobtrusive devices that none even within the Adeptus Mechanicus fully understand. Some are impossibly ancient archaeotech creations from the Dark Age of Technology, considered holy relics to be venerated and sanctified before each use. Unless stated otherwise, force fields offer protection for the entire body. It is a Half Action to turn the field on or off. A character may only benefit from one field at a time, regardless of how many different fields he may have equipped. When a character wearing an active field is attacked, but before Evasion tests are made, roll 1d100. If the result is lower than or equal to the field's protection rating, the attack is nullified and has no effect on the protected character (although the attack might have an impact on the character's surroundings or other nearby characters, such as with weapons with the Blast quality).

Fields can also overload. Compare the 1d100 roll to avoid damage to Table Field Overload Chance. If the result is lower than or equal to the listed number, the field overloads. It ceases to function until it is recharged or repaired, requiring a successful Very Hard (–30) Tech-Use test.

### Field Overload Chance

| Field Craftsmanship | Overload Roll |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| **Poor**                | 01-15         |
| **Common**              | 01-10         |
| **Good**                | 01-05         |
| **Best**                | 01            |
