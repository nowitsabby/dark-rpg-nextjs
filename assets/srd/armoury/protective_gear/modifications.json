      "availability": "Common",
      "upgrades": "Any armour, helmet, or backpack.",
      "description": "A brazier must be affixed to a backpack, helmet, or similarly worn item. Setting it aflame requires a Half Action and it can burn for 2 hours. Whilst alight, it acts as a glow-globe and grants a +30 bonus to all Charm and Command tests, a +10 bonus to Intimidate tests, and a -40 penalty to all Stealth tests. If the wearer is ever knocked Prone while it is lit, he must pass an Ordinary (+10) Agility test to avoid setting himself on fire.",

      "upgrades": "Any armour",
      "description": "Characters with Insulated upgrades to their armour do not need to take Toughness Tests due to hot temperatures or environments (within reason, as this will not protect against the extreme heat of being burned, for example).",

      "weight": "+3 kg",
      "availability": "Common",
      "upgrades": "Flak, Carapace, Power",
      "description": "Any melee hits against the wearer to a spike-covered part of their body result in the attacker suffering 1d5+1 R Damage to the attacker (Dodge or Parry can negate, as the attacker attempts to twist out of the way). In addition, so long as the upgraded armour covers the wearer's arms, the wearer always counts as being armed with a Knife in melee.",

      "availability": "Common",
      "upgrades": "Any armour",
      "description": "Working the unguents onto armour takes roughly one hour, and empties one container for each hit location treated. As part of the process, careful rituals must also be performed to inscribe runes and litanies into the armour. This requires a Hard (-20) Scholastic Lore (Occult) or Forbidden Lore (Imperial Creed) test for each location; failure means the unguents must be cleaned off that location and the ritual started again. For each hit location treated with Unguents of Warding, the armour grants its wearer a +5 bonus to tests to resist Fear caused by characters with the Daemonic trait and to resist psychic powers. The effects of the unguents last for one month (or less due to wear and tear or contamination, at the GM's discretion).",

      "upgrades": "Any helmet",
      "description": "While a basic helmet will offer simple cranial protection, specific upgrades can also add advanced vox links, targeting feeds, visual augmentations, combat data readouts, and more. These can include the benefits of wearing such items as preysense goggles, a rebreather, photo-visor, vox-caster, or micro-bead, with standard upgrades containing all but preysense goggles. Good Craftsmanship models contain the goggles as well, while the user can only choose two of the above for Poor models.",

When activated, reduce the wearer's Agility by half (this also affects Movement), but the wearer may otherwise move normally in low or zero-gravity areas provided there is a suitable surface to walk on.\n\nThis is a power armour sub-system.

While worn by a character with the Mechanicus Implants trait, this suit of armour does not need to be recharged or replenished to operate. However, the standard power source is removed (reducing the weight by 15%) so this armour will not function when worn by a character without the Mechanicus Implants trait\n\nThis is a power armour sub-system.
