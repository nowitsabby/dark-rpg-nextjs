      "description": "Terminator armour grants the wearer the Auto-Stabilised and Unnatural Strength (3) trait (or increases the value of this Trait by 3), and increases the value of his Size (X) trait by 1. While in Terminator armour, the user can wield two-handed melee weapons and fire Basic and Heavy Weapons one-handed, but cannot use Pistols. Other weapons, particularly small or delicate ones, might also be unusable in terminator armour. The GM has final say on what can or cannot be used. Terminator armour counts as having a force field with a protection rating of 35, however, this represents shots glancing off the armour's strongest surfaces, so there is no chance for an overload. Delicate tasks suffer a -10 penalty and the user cannot Run or Dodge. When used with the detachable helmet, it is environmentally sealed with its own oxygen supply and voxcaster systems. Its power supply can operate for 24 hours before recharging or refueling is needed, and while powered the suit's weight does not count towards the user's carry limit",
