# Vehicle Combat

Combat is not limited to battles between personal opponents. On habways and battlefields alike across the galaxy, vehicles of all manner of sizes and power are part of Mankind's struggle for survival. This section describes how players use vehicles in combat situations, including firing vehicle weapons, ramming, and resolving vehicle damage.

Vehicles are designed to be integrated directly into structured time. Characters using vehicles in combat still occupy a normal slot in the Initiative order, still act during their turn, and still take actions via Half Actions, Full Actions, Reactions, and the like. A character embarked in a vehicle can perform many of her normal actions, and can also perform a number of actions exclusive to characters embarked in a vehicle. The actions that pertain to direct control over the vehicle usually require the character to be the vehicle's operator (the main driver), while other actions such as firing a vehicle weapon can be performed by a passenger.

## Vehicle Combat Actions 

An operator can drive or otherwise direct her vehicle in a wide manner of manoeuvres or attacks, the better to pursue (or escape from) heretics and other enemies. As a general rule, a vehicle must move directly forward or backward at least its own length before turning 90° in any direction. It can turn more than once, provided it moves a sufficient distance each time.

| Action | Type | Subtype(s) | Test | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Aerial Manoeuvre: Lock On** | Half | Movement | Opposed Challenging (+0) Operate + Manoeuvrability | The pilot attempts to get behind her adversary As part of this action, the pilot makes an Opposed Challenging (+0) Operate + Manoeuvrability test against a single enemy craft. If she succeeds, and is able to end her movement so that her craft is able to target that craft, then she and each other character aboard her craft gains a +20 bonus to Ballistic Skill tests against that opponent. If she scores 3 or more degrees of success higher than the opponent, she can also immediately fire any pilot-controlled weapons at that enemy as a Free Action. Other enemies, however, gain a +10 bonus to Ballistic Skill tests against the pilot's craft until the start of the pilot's next turn. |
| **Aerial Manoeuvre: Tight Turn** | Full | Concentration, Movement | As part of this action, the pilot makes a Challenging (+0) Operate + Manoeuvrability test. The vehicle moves its Tactical Speed, following the standard combat movement restrictions. If she succeeds on the test, she may turn the vehicle make a 90° each time it moves its own length in distance (instead of only 45°) and may increase or decrease the flyer's Altitude by one level. |
| **Crushing Charge** | Full | Attack, Concentration, Melee, Movement | Routine (+20) Weapon Skill | A character can only use this action with Living Steeds or Bikes. The operator puts her Mount into a sprint, offering a fearsome display of speed and aggression. Few can stand up to such raw power, and many foes break before their attackers even reach their lines when faced with a cavalry charge. The Mount's rider has it move towards a target that is at least four metres away but still within its Charge Move. The last four metres of the Crushing Charge must be in a straight line. Once the pair reach their target, the rider makes a single melee attack by making a Routine (+20) Weapon Skill Test. If she succeeds, she inflicts one hit that cannot be Parried on the target, and her target must make a Challenging (+0) Opposed Strength Test against the Mount or be knocked Prone. For Bikes, use the vehicle's Tactical Speed. |
| **Evasive Manoeuvring** | Full | Concentration, Movement | Challenging (+0) Operate + Manoeuvrability | The vehicle weaves and dodges, presenting a hard target. As part of this action, the operator must make a Challenging (+0) Operate test. The vehicle moves its Tactical Speed, following normal movement restrictions. If the operator succeeded on her test, the vehicle imposes a –10 penalty on all attacks made against it for every degree of success the operator scored on the test until the beginning of the operator's next turn (ranged attacks made from the vehicle during that time suffer the same penalty). If the operator fails the test by five or more degrees of failure, the vehicle goes Out of Control.\n\n**Living Steed:** The rider has her steed make a Full Move in an erratic pattern. This requires a Hard (–20) Survival test with a bonus equal to the steed's Agility characteristic. |
| **Floor It!** | Full | Concentration, Movement | Difficult (–10) Operate + Manoeuvrability The operator slams down the pedal (or equivalent), and the vehicle surges forward at top speed. As a part of this action, the operator makes a Difficult (–10) Operate + Manoeuvrability test. If she succeeds, the vehicle moves double its Tactical Speed, plus five additional metres for every degree of success the operator scored on her test. The vehicle imposes a –20 penalty on all attacks made against it until the beginning of the operator's next turn (ranged attacks made from the vehicle during that time suffer the same penalty). If the operator failed her test by five or more degrees of failure, the vehicle goes Out of Control. This action cannot be used with a Walker unless it is a Living Steed.\n\n**Living Steed:** The steed moves its Run distance. |
| **Hit & Run** | Full | Attack, Melee, Movement | Difficult (–10) Weapon Skill | Some vehicles are small enough that they act more as personal transports. These include ganger bikes and Eldar Jetbikes, but also living steeds ridden into combat. Their drivers can coast past enemies at high speed, slashing their foes with handheld weapons as they move past. The attack is quick and brutal, with the driver often leaving her opponent in bloody ruin behind her. The vehicle's operator makes a Difficult (–10) Weapon Skill test and the vehicle moves a distance up to its Tactical Speed. If the operator succeeded on her test, she inflicts a single hit upon a target within range with an appropriate melee weapon. If she fails the Weapon Skill test by three or more degrees of failure, the vehicle goes Out of Control. Once the attack has been resolved, the operator may move the vehicle up to its Tactical Speed directly away from the target as a part of this action. The attack's target cannot make a Free Attack against the vehicle or its passengers because of this movement. A character can only use this action if she is operating a vehicle with the Open-Topped or, Bike trait. It cannot be used with a Walker unless it is a Living Steed.\n\n**Living Steed:** The steed instead moves up to its Charge distance, then after the attack can make a second movement up to its Charge distance. |
| **Jink** | Reaction | Movement | Challenging (+0) Operate - Size Modifier + Manoeuvrability | The driver sees a threat and twists the wheel or hits the thrusters suddenly, hopefully throwing her vehicle out of the line of fire. Unless piloting a Walker, she can only use this Reaction if her vehicle moved at least its Tactical Speed during the previous round. In response to an attack she is aware of, the operator can make a Challenging (+0) Operate test with a penalty equal to the vehicle's Size trait. If she succeeds, she negates one hit from a single attack, plus one additional hit per degree of success she scores beyond the first. If the driver fails the test by five or more degrees of failure, the vehicle goes Out of Control. |
| **Ram!** | Full | Attack, Melee, Movement | One of the deadliest ways to utilise a vehicle is as a blunt instrument. Many enemies of humanity have died beneath the grinding treads of the Imperium's tanks. As part of this action, the operator makes a Challenging (+0) Operate test. The vehicle moves a number of metres up to twice its Tactical Speed. It must move at least a number of metres equal to its Tactical Speed in a straight line. If the operator succeeds, the vehicle collides with an object within 3 metres at the end of the move. It inflicts a single hit upon the target that causes 1d10 Impact damage, plus additional damage equal to the vehicle's Armour points (AP) on the facing that struck the target. For every 10 metres the vehicle moved beyond its Tactical Speed as a part of this action, it inflicts an additional 1d10 damage. For every point of damage the ramming vehicle inflicts, it moves its target 1 metre. This attack cannot be Parried. If the target suffers the hit but prevents the damage (such as via a force field), it is still moved a number of metres equal to the damage it would have suffered. If the vehicle collides with another vehicle (or something else of suitable size and density), it also suffers damage equal to the AP of the facing of the vehicle or object it struck plus 1d5.\n\n**Living Steed:** Vehicles with the Living trait cannot perform a Ram! action unless they have special rules allowing for it. |
| **Rearing Strike** | Half | Attack, Concentration, Movement | This action can only be performed when operating a vehicle with the Living trait. The steed is incited to attack, smashing its foes with iron-shod hooves, mauling them with savage claws, dismembering them with its vicious teeth, or even disgorging a gout of toxic liquid upon them, depending on the creature. The rider has her mount make one melee or ranged attack, for which the rider makes a Hard (–20) Survival test with a bonus equal to her steed's Weapon Skill characteristic for a melee attack or Ballistic Skill characteristic for a ranged attack. If she succeeds, the steed inflicts a single hit upon the target with the appropriate weapon. |
| **Tactical Manoeuvring** | Varies | Movement | The operator drives the vehicle carefully to its destination using its standard Movement action. The vehicle moves either its Tactical Speed (as a Half Action) or twice its Tactical Speed (as a Full Action), following the standard movement restrictions. |


# Vehicles in Combat 

Characters operating vehicles can take actions as normal during structured time. Some of these actions vary from those available to characters not operating vehicles, but still fall into the same basic categories: Half Actions, Full Actions, Reactions, Free Actions, and Extended actions, and have the same action sub-types (Movement, Concentration, etc.).

Some vehicles have multiple crewmembers. In such cases, the vehicle's commander's Initiative roll determines the Initiative of the remaining crew (if there is no one in charge of the crew, use the operator's Initiative). The order of Initiative should be rearranged so the crewmember that rolled the highest Initiative takes her turn immediately after the commander (or driver), then the crewmember with the next highest Initiative, and so forth. Each crewmember can take a different action, but each still has only the normal number of actions during her turn. For example, a driver can move the vehicle, while passengers can use mounted or personal firearms to spray their targets with shots or take other actions they could reasonably execute within a vehicle

## Vehicle Attacks 

-   Any attack actions a vehicle's gunner or passenger can take are the same as those listed on Combat Actions, with the following notes:
-   Any shooting from a vehicle suffers a -10 to hit if the vehicle moved its Tactical Speed during the previous round.
-   Any shooting from a vehicle suffers a -20 to hit if the vehicle moved twice its Tactical Speed in the previous round.
-   Gunners or passengers can take Full Actions even if the vehicle has moved.
-   Passengers can only fire from a vehicle if they are in a position to do so (such as if the vehicle is Open-Topped, or has hatches or vision slits that could be used as firing positions). The type of vehicle they are shooting from determines what facing passengers have when firing their own weapons.
-   Critical effects that hamper the crew's ability to make attacks hamper passengers in exactly the same manner.
-   A character with the appropriate Operate skill for a vehicle does not need specific weapon proficiencies to fire any weapons mounted on that type of vehicle without penalty. It is assumed that her expertise covers weapon use as well.
-   All weapons mounted on a vehicle, including Pintle Mounted weapons, are automatically assumed to be braced. Personal weapons fired by passengers that require bracing must be braced normally before being used.

## Attacking Vehicles 

Attacking a vehicle follows a very similar process to standard attacks, and follows many of the procedures and rules that govern attacks. There are a few key differences, such as facing and different Hit Locations, and these are described below. As with standard attacks, no one can attack a vehicle until the GM has verified that the attack is even possible by checking the requirements of the attack. Melee attacks against vehicles require the attacker to be engaged in melee combat with her target. The usual penalties for ranged attacks made while engaged with an enemy apply to vehicles. The Spray & Pray rules can apply to attacks made against vehicles as well. Assuming the attack is possible, follow these steps:

-   **Step One:** Apply Modifiers to Attack
-   **Step Two:** Attacker Determines Facing
-   **Step Three:** Attacker Makes a Test
-   **Step Four:** Attacker Determine Hit Location
-   **Step Five:** Attacker Determines Damage
-   **Step Six:** Target Applies Damage

### Step One: Apply Modifiers to Attack

Melee and ranged attacks made against vehicles follow the same methods for determining modifiers as regular attacks, except as noted. For example, most vehicles have a Size modifier that provides attackers a bonus to hit.

### Step Two: Attacker Determines Facing 

Unlike most standard characters, creatures, and NPCs, the direction a vehicle is attacked from matters quite a bit. Vehicles are protected by heavy armour plating, but this plating tends to be thicker or thinner depending on where on the vehicle it is. Generally speaking, thicker armour is placed upon a vehicle's front and, if it has one, its turret. Weaker armour is often placed on a vehicle's rear quarters. These different areas of a vehicle are referred to as facings.

When making any type of attack against a vehicle, the attacker needs to know what facing her attack hits. A vehicle is divided roughly into four quarters, each of a 90° angle. The angle to the front of the vehicle is the Front facing. The two angles to the left and right of the vehicle are the Left Side and Right Side facings. The angle to the rear of the vehicle is the Rear facing.

The facing the attack hits determines how much armour the attack must overcome to cause damage to the vehicle's integrity. If needed for attacks coming from above or below the vehicle, use the Rear facing to resolve armour and damage.

### Step Three: Attacker Makes a Test 

After the modified characteristic and the facing have been determined, the attacker makes a Weapon Skill test if she is performing a melee attack, or a Ballistic Skill test if performing a ranged attack. If the result of the roll is equal to or less than the modified characteristic, the attack hits.

#### Evasion Reactions 

Vehicles have access to the Jink action that can be used as a Reaction. Vehicles cannot Dodge, and only Walkers can Parry (and then only if they have arms with which to Parry). See the Jink action for more details on how this Reaction operates.

### Step Four: Attacker Determines Hit Location 

The attacker already knows which facing her attack struck by determining where her attack came from in relation to the vehicle's current orientation. In most cases, attacks come directly from the attacker, but explosives and weapons with indirect fire can strike other facings of a vehicle. On a successful hit, a character must also determine where exactly her hit struck. Using the percentile dice result from the attacker's Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill test, reverse the order of the digits (e.g., a result of 32 becomes 23, a result of 20 becomes 02, and so on) and compare this number to Table Vehicle Hit Locations.

As mentioned previously, whenever the location hit is the Turret, the attack is treated as if it hit the vehicle's Front facing, even if the shot originated in the Rear facing.

When a character strikes a vehicle with an attack that inflicts multiple hits (such as a Swift Attack action or Full-Auto Attack action), she spreads each hit after the first much as she would against any other target. Extra hits beyond the first can either be allocated to the original target or any other targets within range, provided none of the new targets would have been harder to hit than the original target. If extra hits are allocated to the same target, roll on Table Vehicle Hit Locations to determine the locations these additional attacks strike.

### Step Five: Attacker Determines Damage 

This process functions in exactly the same way as with regular attacks with the exception of how Righteous Fury works against vehicles.

#### Righteous Fury and Vehicles 

Attacks against vehicles also benefit from the Righteous Fury rules. Righteous Fury against vehicles is generated in the same manner as against other targets. Instead of rolling on one of the Critical Effect tables for personal injuries, the attacker rolls 1d5 on the appropriate Vehicle Critical Effect table, based on the vehicle Hit Location she struck. The vehicle suffers the listed effect. However, the vehicle does not count as having sustained Critical damage this way, and the Vehicle Critical Effect it suffers is not cumulative with actual Critical damage.

### Step Six: Target Applies Damage 

Vehicles have two primary defensive characteristics: Armour points (also referred to as Armour or AP) and integrity.

Armour represents both the innate hardness of the materials used to construct a vehicle, as well as the physical protection built into a vehicle to defend against attacks. The thick ceramite hull of a Leman Russ Demolisher, for example, has extremely good armour, while the ramshackle hull of an Ork Trukk has extremely poor armour. Vehicles often have different Armour points for each facing. The front of a Leman Russ battle tank is nigh invulnerable, for example, but a shot to the weaker rear facing may have a devastating effect. Armour points function in the same manner as Armour points for a person or creature. When a hit causes damage to a vehicle, roll damage then subtract the vehicle's AP from the damage (taking into account the weapon's penetration value).

Integrity is a representation of how much damage a vehicle can sustain before exploding into ruin. It can be affected by any number of things, from the sturdiness of the materials used to construct the vehicle to the amount of sub-system redundancy built into critical components.

Integrity functions in the same way for vehicles as wounds do for characters. After a hit's damage has been reduced by a vehicle's AP, the remaining damage is applied to the vehicle's integrity, reducing it by that amount.

#### Vehicle Critical Damage 

When a vehicle has sustained an amount of damage equal to its integrity, all additional damage is treated as Critical damage in the same manner as Critical damage is applied to people and creatures. Consult the appropriate Vehicle Critical Effect table (dependent on where the vehicle was hit by the attack that caused the Critical damage) and apply the result. Like the standard Critical Effect tables for individuals, results on the Vehicle Critical Effect tables are cumulative. For example, if a vehicle suffers 2 damage to its Hull after already sustaining damage equal to its integrity, it suffers the "2" result on the Hull Critical Effects table. If it then suffers 4 more damage from a hit that struck its Motive Systems, it suffers the "6" result on the Motive System Critical Hit Effects table.

## Out of Control, Crashing, and Falling Over 

There are many instances where the movements of a vehicle will be beyond a driver's ability to control. Some vehicles go Out of Control in different ways than Wheeled and Tracked vehicles; Skimmers Crash, for instance, and Walkers Fall Over

### Out of Control (Wheeled & Tracked Vehicles) 

Whenever a vehicle goes Out of Control, either due to circumstance or due to Critical damage, the vehicle must move during its next round (the operator has no choice in this). To determine the direction, roll 1d10 on Table 7-30: Out of Control Direction. Once the direction has been determined, the vehicle moves its Tactical Speed plus 1d10 metres in that direction. Anything it strikes suffers a single hit as if the vehicle had performed a Ram! action on it. The vehicle suffers the consequences of that action as normal. The crew and passengers must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness test or be Stunned for 1 round if the vehicle collides with something this way.

### Crashing (Skimmers) 

One of the chief drawbacks to skimmers is how fragile their propulsion systems tend to be. An immobilised tank usually grinds to a halt, but a Skimmer can find itself crashing directly into the ground and exploding in a fireball that kills everyone on board. If an effect would ever cause a Skimmer to go Out of Control, it Crashes instead. A crashing Skimmer moving within 10 metres of the ground suffers the following effects:

-   If the distance the Skimmer moved (or was attempting to move) during that turn was as equal to its Tactical Speed or less, it moves half the distance it was attempting to travel in its current direction. It then comes to a complete stop. Roll 1d5 on the Table Hull Critical Effects above; the vehicle suffers that result. Anything it strikes suffers a single hit as if it had performed a Ram! action on it, and the vehicle suffers the consequences of that action.
-   If the distance the Skimmer moved (or was attempting to move) is greater than its Tactical Speed, it travels a number of metres equal to its Tactical Speed in a direction determined by the GM, then swerves 1d10 metres in a random direction (see the Scatter Diagram) before crashing to a complete stop. Roll 1d10 on Table: Hull Critical Hit Effects above - it suffers that result. Anything it strikes suffers a single hit as if it had performed a standard Ram! action on it.
-   If a Skimmer crashes while moving at its Tactical Speed or faster, it may also roll on impact. In this case, roll 1d10; on a 6 or higher, it rolls onto its roof (or, if it was moving at high speeds might even cartwheel end over end). When rolling for the Critical Effect, add +4 to the roll. If it survives, it loses half its integrity, and must be repaired before it can be used again. At the GM's discretion, it might be completely wrecked and unusable instead.

If a Skimmer moving more than 10 metres above the ground crashes, the results are far worse. The pilot has time to make a single Very Hard (-30) Operate test. If she succeeds, the vehicle crash-lands. The vehicle is destroyed, and anyone inside suffers 2d10 Impact damage ignoring Armour, and is Stunned for a number of rounds equal to the damage she suffered (after reduction for Toughness bonus). If she fails the test, the vehicle ploughs into the ground and explodes, as per the 10+ result on Table Hull Critical Effects. Individuals can bail out at the last second according to the rules, although they count as falling from whatever altitude the vehicle was at the turn before it Crashed.

### Falling Over (Walkers) 

If an effect would ever cause a Walker to go Out of Control, it Falls Over instead. Whenever a Walker falls over, the driver or rider rolls on the Scatter Diagram to determine which direction it falls; this also determines what facing it lands on. The Walker takes 1d10 damage to that facing and a randomly determined vehicle Hit Location. If the Walker falls a dangerous distance, it suffers 1d10 Impact damage plus 1 damage per metre it fell to a randomly determined Hit Location. This damage ignores Armour in both cases. The operator must take a Challenging (+0) Toughness test or be Stunned for one round. Assuming the walker is capable of moving, it can stand up as a Full Action.

# On Fire! 

A vehicle catching fire is very bad for everyone involved. Unlike living creatures, which tend to run around screaming before falling over dead, vehicles have a nasty habit of exploding if they remain alight for too long, as fuel tanks, reactor cores, and ammunition bays detonate. When this happens, there is often little left of the vehicle (or the crew) to salvage.

## Vehicles on Fire 

Each second a vehicle remains on fire is another moment where something unstable could ignite and explode. If a vehicle ever catches fire, the GM should roll 1d10 for it at the end of each round. If the result is less than or equal to 9 nothing happens this time, roll again next round. If the result is 10 or more, something explosive ignites, and the vehicle suffers 8 Critical damage to the Hull (ignoring Armour).

The chance of exploding increases every round. For every round after the first that a vehicle remains on fire, the GM should add +1 to the roll (for example, at the end of the fourth round that a vehicle has been on fire, the GM would add +3 to the Roll).

## Inside a Flaming Vehicle 

If being near a vehicle that is on fire is bad, then being inside a flaming vehicle is much worse. Vehicle crews and passengers have limited time to extinguish flames before vital (and explosive) equipment is destroyed. At the start of any crewmember or passenger's turn, she can attempt to put out the fire by using internal fire suppressant systems, fire extinguishers or whatever she happens to have on hand. This is done as a Full Action via a Hard (-20) Agility test. If the character succeeds, she puts the fires out, and the crew can breathe a sigh of relief (although the vehicle can still be set on fire again). If character fails the test, the vehicle remains aflame until the fire is put out or the vehicle explodes. The GM can increase or decrease the difficulty of this test due to special conditions (putting a fire out in the pouring rain is easier than putting a fire out in the middle of the scorching desert). Crew inside a flaming vehicle suffer a -20 penalty to all tests they have to make (the -20 is included in the Agility test above, not in addition to it). If the fire is successfully put out, the crew and the passengers can act normally from that point on without suffering the -20 penalty. The vehicle itself gains the Fire Damaged damage condition.

## Crew and Passengers on Fire! 

As noted in a number of results on the Vehicle Critical Effect tables, it is possible for crewmembers and passengers to also be set alight even when the vehicle itself is not on fire. When a crewmember or passenger is set alight, she follows the standard rules for being set on fire. At the end of each round during which a vehicle had burning passengers inside it, the GM should roll 1d10 for each person inside who was on fire. On a result of 10, the vehicle also catches fire. On any other result, the vehicle does not catch fire.
