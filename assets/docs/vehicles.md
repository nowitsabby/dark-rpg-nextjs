# Vehicles

## Types

There are six types of vehicles:

-   **Tracked:** While wheeled tyres are easy to manufacture and replace, many Imperial war machines make use of massive, grinding treads instead. Tracks allow a vehicle to barrel forward through difficult terrain without losing traction, and are much more resilient to small arms rounds. Unless otherwise noted, vehicles with this trait must remain on the ground at all times while moving.
-   **Wheeled:** The wheel is one of humanity's most versatile inventions, and many vehicles still benefit from the means of transport it provides. Wheeled vehicles are also easier to repair than their more resilient tracked counterparts; replacing a damaged wheel takes far less time and expertise in the ways of the machine spirits than resetting a fouled set of treads. Unless otherwise noted, vehicles with this trait must remain on the ground at all times while moving.
-   **Skimmers:** These vehicles hover over the ground, floating from place to place as their whirring engines stir up the dust below. Thanks to their ability to defy gravity, Skimmers can be extremely fast and nimble, though they also tend to be more fragile than ground-based vehicles.
-   **Walkers:** This vehicle's motive systems are not wheels or treads, but legs. Whether these be of steel, grafted synthmuscle, or even natural flesh and blood, this vehicle moves more like a creature than a standard vehicle. Walkers are typically not as fast as Wheeled or Tracked vehicles, but are often more agile and more capable of negotiating difficult terrain.
-   **Aircraft:** These use the aerodynamic principles of lift and powerful engines to remain aloft. They can range from exotic flying mounts to air superiority fighters like the Imperial Navy Thunderbolt.
-   **Spacecraft:** These vehicles are capable of travelling through the cold vacuum of space. Although this vehicle trait does not include the massive, kilometres-long Imperial starships, it does include various kinds of smaller craft that these mighty vessels employ, including Aquila landers, Arvus lighters, and Fury interceptors.

Vehicles have two different modes of movement:

-   **Cruising Speed:** A vehicle's Cruising Speed represents how fast a vehicle moves when it is travelling long distances and is therefore mostly relevant to narrative time. This speed is also used for high-speed situations, such as chases.
-   **Tactical Speed:** A vehicle's Tactical Speed represents how fast a vehicle moves in situations that require skillful handling, or when the vehicle is operating in a limited or specific area such as a narrow canyon or small field. This is not the vehicle's full speed, but an abstraction of the distance it can move taking into account turns, acceleration, driver distractions, and terrain. Vehicles use Tactical Speed during structured time.

## Driving a Vehicle 

To drive a vehicle, a character must have the relevant Operate skill. PCs might be able to drive simple ground vehicles untrained at the Game Master's discretion (with a suitable penalty to any required skill tests) but driving a walker or piloting a skimmer would be beyond their expertise.

When driving a vehicle, a character with training in the correct skill does not have to make skill tests to perform routine driving. The character is assumed to know how to start the vehicle, steer, and obey any relevant local driving customs or regulations.

Skill tests come in when the character is attempting something particularly challenging, or is trying to operate the vehicle during combat or a similar high-stress situation. Running another person's vehicle off of the road during a high-speed chase would require a skill test, for example. Deftly weaving a captured Eldar jetbike between the falling spires of a crumbling hive as it undergoes an orbital bombardment would require several.

These skill tests can be standard or Opposed tests, depending on the situation. For instance, the aggressive driving example above would require an Opposed test against the other drivers involved, whereas the latter example would require several standard skill tests. Just like other forms of skill tests, Operate tests for vehicle use can be modified due to circumstances.

Table Difficult Terrain and Other Hazards sums up some of the different types of conditions a vehicle can travel through, and the penalties such conditions imposes on any Operate tests. These penalties are cumulative with any other penalties or bonuses the vehicle or driver can be subject to, such as the vehicle type or any applicable vehicle traits.

## Manoeuvrability 

Much of a vehicle's manoeuvring depends on the skill of the driver, but some vehicles are innately more manoeuvrable than others. An Eldar Falcon grav-tank is extremely fast and nimble, able to duck and weave to avoid enemy fire, whereas a Leman Russ Demolisher is a ponderous leviathan of armour and is more likely to plough straight through a hab block than go around it. A vehicle's Manoeuvrability is a representation of how well a vehicle responds to the commands of its driver or crew. This is represented by the vehicle's Manoeuvrability value, which provides a modifier (either positive or negative) to the driver's Operate skill while operating said vehicle. The vehicle's type can also play a part in how manoeuvrable a vehicle is, as can some vehicle traits. These are noted where applicable.

## Crew and Carrying Capacity 

Many vehicles are designed primarily to carry passengers, either as civilian worker transports or military armoured personnel carriers used to ferry soldiers into combat. Even non-transport vehicles can have large crew complements; the Leman Russ battle tank can have up to six crew at any given time. Other vehicles, such as the nimble Sentinel scout walker, only have room for one. All vehicles have a crew rating that lists both how many crew a vehicle may have at its maximum, as well as what positions those crew must fill (e.g. driver, gunner, sponson gunner, etc.). Some vehicles also have a Carrying Capacity to represent their ability to transport additional personnel outside of their regular crew complement. Carrying Capacity is always looked at in terms of standard-sized humans, and the GM should be sure to keep the vehicle's total Carrying Capacity in mind should larger beings (like Ogryn) or smaller constructs (like servo-skulls) find themselves needing transport. The Chimera armoured transport, for example, has a Carrying Capacity of 12, indicating that twelve standard human-sized people can be transported within the vehicle along with the crew.

## Facings and Integrity 

All vehicles have facings, used to determine how many Armour points an attacker must overcome. They also determine the Firing Arcs of some weapons, especially Fixed and Hull-Mounted weaponry. There are four facings:

-   **Front:** Represented by a 90° arc to the front of the vehicle, any attacks made within this arc strike a vehicle's Front facing and is applied to the Armour points (AP) there.
-   **Rear:** Represented by a 90° arc to the Rear of the vehicle, any attacks made within this arc strike a vehicle's Rear facing and is applied to the AP there.
-   **Left Side/Right Side:** Both of these locations are represented by 90° arcs, and while most vehicles have the same number of Armour points on their left and right side, it is important to distinguish between the two. A vehicle that has a weapon on its Right Side facing but not its Left Side facing cannot suffer damage to that weapon if attacked from the opposite facing. 

Vehicles also have an integrity value, representing how much damage a vehicle can sustain before exploding into ruin. 

## Weapons, Weapon Mounting, and Firing Arcs

Most vehicles in the Imperium are armed, ranging from the heavy stubbers on many civilian autocarriages to the massive volcano cannons mounted on Shadowsword super-heavy tanks. All vehicle weapon entries include the statistics for the weapon, which crew member controls the weapon, and also what Weapon Mounting the weapon has. A weapon's mounting determines its fire arc. Each type of weapon mounting may also have additional rules. There are five main types of weapon mountings:

-   **Fixed:** These weapons are embedded within the hull of a vehicle and cannot turn. They might have a limited vertical traversal ability, but otherwise only fire directly ahead; to turn the gun from left to right, the vehicle itself must move.
-   **Hull:** These are similar to Fixed weapons in that they have a limited range of movement, but can move from left to right as well as up and down. A Hull weapon has a 45° fire arc from the facing the weapon is mounted.
-   **Turret:** Turret-mounted weapons are often placed high on a vehicle on top of its hull to give them the greatest line of sight in as many directions as possible. A Turret weapon has a 360° fire arc, and only the vehicle itself can block this arc (e.g., a vehicle with multiple turrets would find that the fire arc of one turret blocks the other turret, or the vehicle itself depending on its shape). Turrets cannot turn to face directions instantaneously, and thus it takes a Half Action for every full 180° that a turret needs to turn. The GM and the players should always be aware of which direction their turrets are facing, as this can be important for Critical damage. Additionally, due to their heavier armour, turrets treat all hits to them as hits to the Front facing, regardless of the direction the attack came from in relation to the turret's current facing.
-   **Sponson:** Sponson-mounted weapons are often used defensively on the flanks---and sometimes even the rear---of a vehicle, whilst the vehicle's main weapon continues its assault upon the enemy. A Sponson weapon has a 180° fire arc from the facing the weapon is mounted (e.g. a Sponson-mounted Weapon on a vehicle's Left Side facing has a 180° Fire Arc to the left of the vehicle). Walkers, unless specified otherwise, treat all their weapons as Sponson-mounted, specifically a Sponson mounting that gives them a 180° Fire Arc to the Walker's Front facing. This is to represent the fact that most Walkers have the ability to twist their torsos or even move their arms independently of its main body in much the same way as a normal human does.
-   **Pintle:** These are usually optional or additional weapons bolted onto turret rings or placed in areas where spare crew or even passengers can use them. They are usually comparatively light weapons, such as heavy stubbers, and are used to defend the vehicle in much the same way as Sponson weaponry. Unlike the other mounted weaponry, Pintle weapons do not automatically have a crew member assigned to them. Instead, they can be fired by anyone who can realistically reach one during her turn, or who reached one in a previous turn. Pintle weapons usually have a 360° fire arc, as they are often mounted on the highest point of a vehicle, but there are exceptions to this and the GM should be aware of what might block a Pintle weapon's fire arc.

# Vehicle Traits

Much like characters, vehicles possess traits that modify their base rules, granting them new abilities or setting new limitations on the feats they can be used to perform. These traits include various means of locomotion, and also include other characteristics. See Vehicle Traits

# Vehicle Upgrades 

There are two types of vehicle upgrades - Standard and Integral. Standard vehicle upgrades are optional additions that Guardsmen can requisition just like other equipment. If no one is on hand to install the upgrade then the Guardsmen can do it themselves just as if they were Repairing the vehicle. Integral vehicle upgrades cannot be added to a vehicle; the vehicle must come with that upgrade from the start. The GM has final say on what Integral Vehicle Upgrades a vehicle might have. All vehicle upgrades have an associated Difficulty Rating with the base Difficulty of the Test to repair them; for Standard Vehicle Upgrades, this Difficulty Rating the base Difficulty for installation. A vehicle can only have one instance of any given upgrade at a time. Unless specifically mentioned otherwise, vehicles with the Living Trait may not be upgraded.
