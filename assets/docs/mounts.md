# Living Steeds

Riding a living mount into combat is treated as both driving a vehicle and having an NPC ally. 

Living steeds use profiles much like standard NPCs, and follow many of the same rules that they do when in combat. Mounts use Wounds, and suffer hits to body locations typical for their form factor (Head, Body, Legs, etc.). Damage is reduced by Armour and Toughness Bonus like normal for an NPC. A character can ride any Living mount with a Size trait larger than her own Size trait unless the mount's specific traits or abilities say otherwise.

For Actions, if follows the rules for vehicles. It does not act on its own, instead being 'piloted' by its rider. A living mount typically counts as a vehicle with the Open-Topped and Walker traits, has 1 crew, the rider, and room for 1 passenger, someone riding pillion. There can be exceptions to this, such as a mount pulling a chariot, a flying steed counting as having the Flyer vehicle trait, or massive mounts such as a Squiggoth counting as Super-Heavy, requiring multiple crew and having room for many more passengers. If any rule associated with operating a vehicle mentions a vehicle hit location, use an equivalent location on the Steed itself. Legs for Motive Systems or Head for Turret, for example.

Riding a mount uses the Wrangling special use of the Survival skill. Simply riding most steeds under normal conditions does not usually require a test, but when performing vehicle actions that would require the rider to make an Operate test, they make a Survival test instead. A living steed's Maneuverability is equal to half its Agility characteristic, rounded up. Some vehicle actions will call out special rules or uses for **Living Steeds** in their description.

Living vehicles can sometimes be repaired with the Tech-Use skill if they have extensive cybernetic components. However, for mostly organic creatures, treat wounds and critical wounds as normal for the purposes of healing like other living creatures, which can occur via natural healing or with use of the Medicae skill.
