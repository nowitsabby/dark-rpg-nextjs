# Damage & Repair 

Just as injuries take time to heal, vehicles take time to repair. A thrown track link or broken ammo feed might take no more than a few hours to replace, whereas a crippled turret or burnt-out interior might see the vehicle languishing in a repair bay for weeks. As players care for their own characters, so too will they need to keep track of how damaged their vehicles are in order to keep them in peak working condition.

## Repairing Vehicles 

Unlike living beings, vehicles do not heal naturally over time and must be repaired manually. Some repairs are easier than others, some repairs require more time, and sometimes conditions might make repairs next to impossible. The rules below cover the types of vehicle damage a vehicle, what skills are required for repairs, repair difficulty, and their duration.

### The Repair Test 

Repairing any of the different vehicle damage types (see Damage Conditions below) requires a Repair test. This is a standard skill test with the exception that players can use a number of different skills for the test rather than one specific skill (such as Tech-Use). This is conducted in this way to give Acolytes the chance to repair minor damage, yet at the same time requiring significant technical skill, such as Forbidden Lore (Adeptus Mechanicus) and Tech-Use, for more crippling damage.

A character must have training in at least one of the following skills to attempt a Repair test:

-   Common Lore (Adeptus Mechanicus)
-   Common Lore (Tech)
-   Forbidden Lore (Adeptus Mechanicus)

Collectively these three skills are referred to as ***Essential Repair skills***, and they are the bare minimum required for even the simplest Repair test. A character need not possess all three in order to attempt a Repair test, but she must have at least one at Known (rank 1). A number of Repair tests also require additional skills before they can be attempted; any additional skill prerequisites are listed in each individual damage condition.

A successful result reverses the damage condition or repairs the integrity or Critical damage the character attempted to negate.

Some Repair tests have other skills as prerequisites, but the character need not make the Repair test using that particular skill and may instead use one of the ***Essential Repair skills*** listed above. For example, repairing a Critically Damaged vehicle requires the character to possess Tech-Use or Trade (Armourer) as a Known (rank 1) or higher skill, but if the character had Forbidden Lore (Adeptus Mechanicus) +20 and it would provide a better chance of succeeding on the test, then she can make the test using that skill instead. This represents the Acolyte using her accumulated knowledge in making the most efficient choices during the repairs.

### Repair Difficulty 

The difficulty of a Repair test depends on its complexity and local conditions: repair facilities, environmental problems like storms or blizzards, and so on. It is also possible to decrease the test difficulty by having more advanced skills than the minimum requirements. Each damage condition has its own associated base Difficulty Rating, but in addition to this modifiers in Table Repair Location & Conditions can both help and hinder Repair tests.

### Repair Time 

Another important element to a Repair test is duration for the repairs. Re-linking a thrown track, banging the dents out of armour plating, or fixing a weapon that has been locked in position usually requires less time than replacing a targeting system or installing a new grav-engine. Each damage condition has an associated Repair Time rated in hours, days, weeks, or even months, and characters need to determine whether they have enough time to make the required repairs before attempting the Repair test.

Scoring additional degrees of success on the Repair test reduces the repair time, but additional degrees of failure can add to it. It is possible for multiple degrees of failure to result in failed test. This means it must be reattempted (with the time already spent being wasted) or, in some cases, cause further damage to the component under repair. Each damage condition lists any specific additional rules, but Table Repair Success & Failure Time Modifiers lists the basic ways additional degrees of success and degrees of failure can decrease or extend the time for any Repair test.

#### Repair Success & Failure Time Modifiers
| Repair Time Required | Degrees Of Success (Each Additional) | Degrees Of Failure (Each Additional) |
|---|---|---|
| **Up to 4 hours.** | –10 minutes | +10 minutes |
| **Over 4 hours and up to 8 hours.** | –20 minutes | +20 minutes |
| **Over 8 hours and up to 16 hours.** | –30 minutes | +30 minutes |
| **Over 16 hours and up to 48 hours.** | –1 hour | +1 hour |
| **Over 2 days and up to 7 days.** | –4 hours | +4 hours |
| **Over 1 week and up to 2 weeks.** | –12 hours | +12 hours |
| **Over 2 weeks and up to 4 weeks.** | –1 day | +1 day |
| **Over four weeks and up to 2 months** | –4 days | +4 days |
| **Over 2 months and up to 4 months.** | –12 days | +12 days |

#### Rush Jobs 

The PCs can speed up repairs by performing a Rush Job. This halves the required time (e.g., a repair that would normally take 12 hours will take 6 hours), but the Repair test suffers a -30 penalty.

#### Careful Repairs 

Acolytes can also spend more time to perform Careful Repairs. This increases the required time by half (e.g., a normal 12 hour repair will now take 18 hours), but the test gains a +30 bonus.

#### Very Long Repair Times 

Some extremely complex or time consuming repairs could have the Acolytes spending months (in narrative time) conducting a series of repairs. In these situations the GM and the players can work out how many Repair tests they would need to make over this time, or simplify the various required tests into a series or even a single test. For extended durations, the GM needs to determine the modifiers for additional degrees of success and degrees of failure, from Table Repair Success & Failure Time Modifiers, by extrapolating its examples to create the longer time scales.

### Vehicle Construction 

Each species builds their vehicles from a different technology base, and there are many types that have extremely simple or highly complex construction techniques. Though both of Imperial origin, civilian autocars and bikes can differ greatly in complexity and sophistication when compared to the mighty war machines of the Imperial Guard. Some types, such as many underhive carriages or Ork war-buggies, are more a ramshackle assemblage of whatever materials might be available at the time and less a properly consecrated design. Others, particular the heretical xenos-tech of the ancient Eldar, are so advanced as to often be incomprehensible to mere humans. In these cases, the GM should modify the skill requirements, repair difficulty, and repair times to better reflect the alternative construction techniques that go into these types of vehicles.

## Damage Conditions 

Burnt panels and dents in the bodywork are relatively minor issues. More substantial damage can have some very specific effects upon a vehicle, and these are referred to as damage conditions. In all instances, the proper equipment and replacement parts are required for these types of repairs. The characters cannot fix missing armour or a destroyed weapon if they do not possess replacements. The GM has final say on who may attempt the repairs, whether the PCs are in a position to make the repair, and whether the repair is possible in the first place.

| Condition | Skill Requirements | Repair Difficulty | Repair Time | Description |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lightly Damaged** | Essential Repair skill | Challenging (+0). Ordinary (+10) if the character has Tech-Use, Trade (Armourer), or Trade (Technomat). | Varies/1 hour per point of integrity repaired. | Lightly Damaged vehicles are easier to repair, and can generally be repaired by vehicle crews and operators with a basic working knowledge of technology. If a vehicle has suffered damage up to half its total integrity (rounding up), it is Lightly Damaged. A Lightly Damaged vehicle can fight without any penalties. Repairing all the integrity on a Lightly Damaged vehicle requires a character to only make a single Repair test and not one test per point of integrity. |
| **Heavily Damaged** | Essential Repair skill | Arduous (–40). Hard (–20) if the character has Trade (Technomat). Challenging (+0) if the character has Tech- Use or Trade (Armourer). | Varies/4 hour per point of integrity repaired. | Heavily Damaged vehicles take a substantial amount of time and effort to repair, and become greater liabilities the longer they go without repairs. If a vehicle has suffered more damage than half its total integrity (rounding up), but has not yet suffered any Critical damage (other than those caused by Righteous Fury), it is said to be Heavily Damaged. Heavily Damaged vehicles suffer a –10 penalty to all Operate tests in addition to any other penalties or bonuses it may already have. Repairing all the integrity on a Heavily Damaged vehicle requires one Repair test for every 5 points of integrity damage (or fraction thereof). Once a Heavily Damaged vehicle's integrity is repaired to half its starting value, the vehicle is then considered Lightly Damaged. |
| **Critically Damaged** | Tech-Use or Trade (Armourer) | Challenging (+0). Ordinary (+10) if the character has both Tech-Use and Trade (Armourer). | Varies/1 day per point of Critical Damage repaired. | Critically Damaged vehicles take an exceptionally long time to repair, and only rare individuals steeped in the forbidden knowledge of the Omnissiah are truly capable of soothing the machine's wounded spirit and coaxing life into it once again. If a vehicle has suffered any Critical damage (not including Critical damage caused by Righteous Fury), it is Critically Damaged. It is rare for a commander to send a vehicle so heavily damaged into combat, but if a Critically Damaged vehicle is ever forced to fight, its operator suffers a –20 penalty to all Operate tests in addition to any other penalties or bonuses that might be present. Critical damage must be repaired before any repairs can be made to integrity, and each point of Critical damage on a Critically Damaged vehicle must be repaired individually. Once a Critically Damaged vehicle has had every point of Critical damage repaired, it is said to be Heavily Damaged. Repairing Critical damage does not reverse any lingering damage conditions, such as destroyed weapons or vehicle immobilisation. |
| **Fire Damaged** | Essential Repair skill | Routine (+20) | Varies/1 hour for every 6 rounds/30 seconds (or part thereof) the vehicle spent alight or had a crewmember or passenger within it who was on fire. | Fires are understandably just as dangerous for vehicles as they are people. Exposed wires and cabling can melt, fuel systems can explode, and even something simple like seat or a control panel can be destroyed by fire, making operating the vehicle difficult if not impossible. Vehicles that have spent any amount of time on fire due to Critical damage, or that have contained crew or passengers that have been set on fire, are said to be Fire Damaged. All tests taken to Operate a Fire Damaged vehicle suffer a –10 penalty. See On Fire! for details on what happens to a vehicle that has been set on fire. |
| **Motive Systems Impaired** | Essential Repair skill | Challenging (+0). Ordinary (+10) if the character has Tech-Use, Trade (Armourer), or Trade (Technomat). | 4 hours (this time can be extended or decreased due to specific vehicle traits). | A vehicle that suffers a Motive Systems Impaired condition reduces its Tactical Speed by 1d10, and the driver must pass a Challenging (+0) Operate test at the start of her turn if she wants to rotate the vehicle more than once during that turn. If the operator fails the Repair test by three or more degrees, then something has gone wrong during the repairs. The vehicle is now treated as having suffered a Motive Systems Crippled Result. |
| **Motive Systems Crippled** | Trade (Technomat) | Very Hard (–30). Hard (–20) if the character has Tech-Use or Trade (Armourer). | 16 hours (this time can be extended or decreased due to specific vehicle traits). | A vehicle that suffers a Motive Systems Crippled result on the Vehicle Critical Effects tables reduces its Tactical Speed by 2d10 and its Cruising Speed by half. If the operator fails the test by three or more degrees, then something has gone wrong during the repairs. The vehicle is now treated as having suffered a Motive Systems Destroyed Result. |
| **Motive Systems Destroyed** | Tech-Use or Trade (Armourer) | Arduous (–40). Hard (–20) if the character has both Tech-Use and Trade (Armourer). | 2 days (this time can be extended or decreased due to specific Vehicle traits). | A vehicle that suffers a Motive Systems Destroyed condition cannot move under its own power. If the character fails the Repair test by three or more degrees of failure, then she has done something wrong and must reattempt the repairs from scratch. The time used to repair the vehicle's motive systems, including any additional time due to the degrees of failure, is wasted. |
| **Reduced Armour** | Essential Repair skill | Hard (–20). Challenging (+0) if the character has Trade (Armourer). | Varies/4 hours for every 5 points (or fraction thereof) of AP repaired. | Whenever a vehicle suffers a reduction in Armour due to Critical damage, this can be repaired by dividing the missing armour up into groups of 5 AP and taking a Repair test for each individual grouping. If the character fails a Repair test by three or more degrees of failure, then the armour has been installed incorrectly and the Repair test for that specific grouping of AP must be reattempted. |
| **Targetting Systems Destroyed** | Tech-Use or Trade (Armourer), and either Common Lore (Adeptus Mechanicus) or Forbidden Lore (Adeptus Mechanicus). | Very Hard (–30). | 1 week (2 weeks if the vehicle has the Super Heavy vehicle trait). | Whenever a weapon suffers a Targeting System Destroyed result on the Critical Effects tables, it suffers a –20 penalty to all shots taken with that weapon (or location, such as a turret, if it is the location's targeting systems that are destroyed). Repairing a weapon's targeting system is often a complex and time-consuming process involving the installation of targeting cogitators and the appeasement of hallowed machine spirits, and thus only those well-versed in the laws and rituals of the Machine God possess the required knowledge to undertake such a difficult task. Failing the Repair test to restore a vehicle's targeting system results in the machine spirit rejecting its new home; the Repair test must be reattempted. Additionally, the character that attempted the repair must spend one day in silent meditation and reflection on the Great Works of the Omnissiah for every degree of failure on the Repair test. She can reattempt the Repair test once she has finished contemplating how she might have offended the machine spirit she was attempting to install. |
| **Vehicle Destroyed** | N/A | N/A | N/A | A number of results on the Vehicle Critical Effects tables indicate that a vehicle has been destroyed without an internal explosion. This condition cannot be repaired, but items from within can still be recovered at the GM's discretion. Vehicle-mounted weapons mounted that have not been destroyed can be removed; this requires a Repair test as if attempting to repair a Weapon Destroyed result. If the character attempting this test succeeds, the weapon is removed and can possibly be refitted onto another vehicle. In all instances, the GM has final say on what can be salvaged and what, if any, special equipment the characters require before they can salvage any extraordinarily heavy or cumbersome weapons. |
| **Weapon/Turret Locked** | Trade (Technomat) | Challenging (+0) for non-Turret-Mounted weapons. Hard (–20) for Turret-Mounted weapons. If the character has Tech-Use or Trade (Armourer) she gains a +10 bonus. | 16 hours for non-Turret-Mounted weapons. 48 hours for Turret-Mounted weapons | Sometimes a weapon's mounting can be damaged even if the weapon itself remains untouched. Weapons that suffer a Weapon/ Turret Locked result can make ranged attacks, but lose their fire arcs and are treated as Fixed Weapons until the this damage condition has been repaired. If the character fails the Repair test with three or more degrees of failure, something goes terribly wrong and she must reattempt the repair from the start |
| **Weapon Destroyed** | Essential Repair skill | Challenging (+0) for Sponson/Pintle mounted weapons. Hard (–20) for Fixed/Hull/Turret mounted weapons. +10 Bonus if the character has Tech-Use or Trade (Armourer). | 8 hours for Sponson/Pintle mounted weapons. 16 hours for Fixed/Hull/Turret mounted weapons. | Weapons that have suffered a Weapon Destroyed result cannot be repaired and must instead be replaced. The Acolytes must first obtain a new weapon to replace the destroyed one (through a Requisition test). Once a replacement weapon has been acquired, the Repair test is taken in order to install the new weapon. If the character fails the Repair test with two or more degrees of failure, the character has installed the weapon incorrectly and must start the repair over. |
| **Weapon Disabled** | Essential Repair skill | Ordinary (+10) for Sponson/Pintle mounted weapons. Hard (–20) for Fixed/Hull/Turret mounted weapons. +10 Bonus if the character has Tech-Use or Trade (Armourer). | 4 hours for Sponson/Pintle mounted weapons. 8 hours for Fixed/Hull/Turret mounted weapons. | A weapon that suffers a Weapon Disabled result on the Vehicle Critical Effects tables cannot make ranged attacks (or in rare cases, melee attacks for weapons designed for close combat) until it has been repaired via a Repair test. If the character fails the Repair test with three or more degrees of failure, something goes terribly wrong, and the weapon is now too badly damaged to repair and must be replaced (see Weapon Destroyed). |
