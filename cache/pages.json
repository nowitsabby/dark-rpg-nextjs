[{"srdPath":"advancement","title":"Advancement","content":"# Advancement\n\n## Aptitudes\n\nThese represent tasks or abilities for which a character has a natural affinity, and can learn with greater ease than others\\. Characteristic, skill, and talent advances in the game have aptitudes linked to them, usually two \\(though especially rare abilities might have only one\\)\\. Those advances sharing a character's aptitudes are easier for that character to learn, and thus cost fewer experience points to purchase\\. If a character shares one aptitude with an advance, he gains a small discount to purchasing it, and if he shares two aptitudes with the advance he gains a large discount\\. Players can still purchase advances for which they have no shared aptitudes, but these are typically very expensive\\. All characters are considered to possess the 'General' aptitude\n\nNote that if during creation a character gains the same aptitude from different sources, he does not gain it twice\\. He instead chooses and gains a Characteristic\\-based aptitude that he does not already have\\.\n\n## Characteristic Advances\n\nA characteristic advance represents a natural improvement to a character's body or mind\\. When a player purchases an advance in a characteristic, he adds \\+5 to that characteristic permanently\\. Characteristic advances are divided into five progression levels:\n\n- Simple: A small fulfilment of the character's potential\\.\n- Intermediate: A significant and noticeable improvement of the character's capabilities\\.\n- Trained: A measure of the character's improvement beyond most around him\\.\n- Proficient: Active, focused effort upon improving the character's prowess\\.\n- Expert: The limit of a character's natural abilities\n\nAs players set about increasing their characters' characteristics, they must progress through each of the progression levels in turn\\. This begins with Simple and ends at Expert, using the prices on the Characteristic Advances Table\\.\n\nThe costs for characteristic advances are cumulative\\. For instance, a player could not simply pay 500 xp for a \\+10 increase for a characteristic he has one aptitude matched with\\. Instead, the player is required to buy the Simple advance for 250 xp first, and then pay the 500 xp for the Intermediate advance\\.\n\n### Characteristic Advance Costs\nMatching Aptitudes| Simple| Intermediate| Trained| Proficient| Expert \n------------------|------|------------|--------|----------|--------\nTwo               |100 xp|250 xp      |500 xp  |750 xp    |1250 xp \nOne               |250 xp|500 xp      |750 xp  |1,000 xp  |1,500 xp\nZero              |500 xp|750 xp      |1,000 xp|1,500 xp  |2,500 xp\n\n### Characteristic Aptitudes\nCharacteristic |Aptitude 1     |Aptitude 2\n---------------|---------------|----------\nWeapon Skill   |Weapon Skill   |Offence   \nBallistic Skill|Ballistic Skill|Finesse   \nStrength       |Strength       |Offence   \nToughness      |Toughness      |Defence   \nAgility        |Agility        |Finesse   \nIntelligence   |Intelligence   |Knowledge \nPerception     |Perception     |Fieldcraft\nWillpower      |Willpower      |Psyker    \nFellowship     |Fellowship     |Social    \n\n## Skill Advances\n\nPlayer Characters learn new skills or improve existing skills by selecting skill advances\\. The xp cost of skill advances depends on how many aptitudes the character has in common with that skill\\. These advances are divided into four ranks of progression levels, which are as follows:\n\n- Known \\(rank 1\\): The character can use the skill without the –20 penalty for untrained skills\\.\n- Trained \\(rank 2\\): The character receives \\+10 on all skill tests when using this skill\\.\n- Experienced \\(rank 3\\): The character receives a \\+20 bonus on all skill tests when using this skill\\. This bonus replaces the bonus for being Trained\\.\n- Veteran \\(rank 4\\): The character receives a \\+30 bonus to all skill tests when using this skill\\. This bonus replaces the bonus for being Experienced in this skill\\.\n\nWhen improving a skill, a character must progress through each of the levels in turn, starting with Known and ending with Veteran\\. So, for example, players cannot choose to pay for the Trained skill advance for their character without first purchasing the Known skill advance\\. Note that characters might have received the Known or Trained skill advance already through character creation\\.\n\n### Skill Advance Costs\nMatching Aptitudes| Known (Rank 1)| Trained (Rank 2)| Experienced (Rank 3)| Veteran (Rank 4)\n------------------|--------------|----------------|--------------------|----------------\nTwo               |100 xp        |200 xp          |300 xp              |400 xp          \nOne               |200 xp        |400 xp          |600 xp              |800 xp          \nZero              |300 xp        |600 xp          |900 xp              |1,200 xp        \n\n## Talent Purchases\n\nTalents are enhancements that permit a character to use his natural abilities in new fashions\\. These can provide a situational bonus to the use of a skill or characteristic, or provide specific and unusual ways for a character to take advantage of his equipment\\. As with characteristics and skills, talents have aptitudes associated with them \\(usually two, but some might have only one\\), and are discounted based on how many a character shares\\. Talents are also divided into three tiers, representing their relative power levels and the amount of xp needed to purchase them\\. Talents also often have prerequisites that must be met before they can be purchased, no matter what tier they belong to\\.\n\n### Talent Advance Costs\nMatching Aptitudes| Tier One| Tier Two| Tier Three\n------------------|--------|--------|----------\nTwo               |200 xp  |300 xp  |400 xp    \nOne               |300 xp  |450 xp  |600 xp    \nZero              |600 xp  |900 xp  |1,200 xp  \n\n### Taking Talents Multiple Times\n\nSome talents can be taken multiple times, which is noted in the talent's description\\. There are only a few of these talents; the most prominent is Sound Constitution, which increases a Player Character's wounds each time it is taken\\. When taking these talents multiple times, the player simply pays the experience cost each time\\. It should be noted, however, that some talents that can be taken multiple times have a hard limit, indicating the maximum number of times they can be purchased\\.\n\n#### Specialist Talents\n\nSome talents are designated Specialist talents\\. These talents can be selected more than once, with a different specialty each time\\.\n\n## Elite Advances\n\nElite advances are specialised advances that set a character apart significantly\\. Many elite advances can only be acquired under special circumstances, and those that can be obtained through play represent large, fundamental changes to a character\\. To obtain an elite advance, a character must have the permission of the GM, meet all of the prerequisites, and spend the specified amount of experience\\. See Elite Advances for more information.\n","excerpt":"# Advancement  ## Aptitudes"},{"srdPath":"armoury/availability_and_influence","title":"Availability and Influence","content":"# Availability and Influence\n\nThere is no standard currency across the Imperium, and even in established sectors, few respect the coinage of some far-distant world. For most, this is no matter. Very few individuals travel between worlds in the 41st Millennium; the majority of humans spend their entire existence within a few kilometres of their birthplace, as they toil and sweat for the Imperium in the countless billions. Acolytes might gain hoards of precious coins on one world, only to find them worthless on the next. They must rely instead on other means to purchase goods, request aid, and offer material assistance. This is expressed through Influence, here representing tangibles including any accumulated local wealth, but also the intangibles of debts, favours, and reputation. This can sometimes vary from world to world, depending on previous visits or the company currently kept. An Inquisitor might establish credit on a world for his Acolytes to use in equipping themselves, or (for greater covertness) they could be left to develop their own means. Despite their often excellent weapons and equipment, the nature of their duties means they are always seeking alternative gear to fit local settings, restocks of ammunition, repairs to damaged armour, and other essentials. It is through using their Influence that they garner the resources they need to accomplish their missions.\n\n## A Dark Age of Technology\n\nTechnology is commonplace in the Imperium of the 41st Millennium, but it is mysterious and unfathomable. Most actual understanding has been lost over the ages, replaced with dogma, rote instruction, and myth. What little knowledge that remains from is the carefully guarded domain of the Adeptus Mechanicus, and has been for thousands of years. Acolytes may understand the rudiments of how their weapons and gear work, at least in principle, but more likely they know that if they mumble the correct words and make the proper motions and gestures (rubbing oil here, twisting that knob there) their equipment will work. Showing this respect for the machine spirit that dwells within a weapon is always wise, and only those who want their gun to fail in the midst of battle would ignore such observances.\n\n## Acquiring Items\n\nWhen a character wants to acquire an item or resource, he makes a Requisition test. This test represents the character using the various resources he has at his disposal, including local currencies or his fearsome reputation, to attempt to purchase, trade, or extort what he wants from his current location. It also takes into account the item's or resource's overall availability and quality.\n\n### Availability\n\nEvery item has an Availability modifier in its profile that represents how easy or difficult the item is to acquire on an average Imperial world. This modifier is applied to any Requisition test made to attempt to acquire the item. Table Availability Modifiers lists out the Availability levels used, and the modifier each gives to the Requisition test needed to acquire the item. Note that these modifiers stack with any modifiers from craftsmanship levels or other factors that the GM decides to impose.\n\n| Availability | Requisition Modifier |\n|---|---|\n| Ubiquitous | Automatic |\n| Abundant | Easy (+30) |\n| Plentiful | Routine (+20) |\n| Common | Ordinary (+10) |\n| Average | Challenging (+0) |\n| Scarce | Difficult (–10) |\n| Rare | Hard (–20) |\n| Very Rare | Very Hard (–30) |\n| Extremely Rare | Arduous (–40) |\n| Near Unique | Punishing (–50) |\n| Unique | Hellish (–60)/GM's discretion |\n\n### Craftsmanship\n\nThe overall quality of a device is expressed in terms of its craftsmanship. All equipment has a craftsmanship value, classified by Poor, Common, Good, or Best craftsmanship, with Common being the default unless otherwise indicated. This value expresses the care taken when the piece of equipment was created, but also covers how well it has been maintained. A device that might have been of Good craftsmanship when it was created could degrade to Poor after years of abuse and neglect. Weapons and armour offer specific rules for their craftsmanship as outlined below. For other goods and services, their effectiveness and Availability are both modified by their craftsmanship. Because such goods are unlikely to have a frequent impact on game play, the precise effects are subject to the Game Master's judgement. As a general rule, a Poor item might fail at an inopportune time, and a Poor service could take longer to complete and fail to live up to the characters' expectations. In sharp contrast, Good or Best services are completed well within their expected deadlines and should include luxuries that exceed the characters' hopes. Similarly, a Good or Best craftsmanship item might offer unexpected features and prove reliable even under the most extreme circumstances. Players must also consider craftsmanship when acquiring an item through Requisition. The calculation for an item's Availability assumes that it is of Common craftsmanship. If the character is willing to settle for Poor craftsmanship or desires a higher quality item, the Requisition test must reflect this variation. Consult Table Craftsmanship, Requisition, and Repair and add in the appropriate modifier. Availability of alternative craftsmanship products is always subject to the Game Master's discretion. It could be that in a particular setting, the only items available fall into a particular category or range of craftsmanship.\n\n| Craftsmanship Level | Requisition And Repair Modifier | Ranged Weapons | Melee Weapons | Armour |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **1 (Poor)** | +10 | Shoddy and dangerous to use, this weapon has the Unreliable quality. If the weapon already has this quality, then it jams on any failed hit roll. | Lax craftsmanship or poorly balanced work means this weapon inflicts a –10 penalty to all Weapon Skill tests made with it. | Badly fitted, designed, or damaged, Poor armour is difficult to wear. Its Maximum Agility is lowered by 10. |\n| **2 (Common)** | +0 |  |  |  |\n| **3 (Good)** | –20 | This weapon is constructed well and loses the Unreliable quality. If it does not have the Unreliable quality, it gains the Reliable quality. If it already has this quality, there is no further effect beyond the obvious fine workmanship of the weapon. | An eye towards balance and design means this weapon grants a +5 bonus to all Weapon Skill tests made with it. | Well constructed and better fitting, this armour is easier to wear. The Maximum Agility for this armour is increased by 10. |\n| **4 (Best)** | –30 | As fine a piece of craftsmanship as can be found, this weapon gains all the benefits of Good craftsmanship, but also never jams or overheats. | Superior materials and superb design means this weapon grants a +10 bonus to all Weapon Skill tests made with it, and increases the damage it deals by +1. | Finely wrought and perfectly fitted, Best armour is like donning a second skin. Its Maximum Agility is increased by 10 and the AP it provides to each covered location is increased by 1. |\n\n### Damaged Items\n\nEven the most finely wrought item is not immune to impairment, and it can become damaged. This might come from serious mistreatment, ongoing neglect, or specific effects from other items or even psychic powers. Continual use of a sniper rifle as a melee weapon, for example, could lead the GM to declare it is damaged. A damaged item cannot be used, and must be repaired (or replaced); if traded in, its damaged status imposes a –20 penalty on the subsequent Requisition test. Note that damage differs from actual weapon destruction, such as the result of a weapon's Power Field quality destroying another weapon. Destroyed items cannot be repaired.\n\n### Repairing Items\n\nTo repair a damaged item, the character makes a Tech-Use test and applies the repair modifier from Table Craftsmanship, Requisition, and Repair that corresponds with the craftsmanship level for the item. If the test succeeds, the item is repaired and can be used again as normal. If the test fails with four or more degrees of failure, the item is destroyed and no further repair attempts are possible.\n\n## The Requisition Test\n\nTo acquire an item or service, a character must make a Requisition test. To do so, the character makes a test and compare the result to his Influence characteristic. This test is modified by the Availability of the item being acquired, the status of the item being acquired, any items traded, as well as any modifiers decided by the GM due to location-specific conditions. If the character succeeds, he acquires the item or service. Acquired weapons come with two standard ammunition clips, plus one extra clip for every degree of success on the test beyond the first. Successful requisitions for ammo clips yield two clips, plus one extra clip for every degree of success beyond the first, while those for grenades, drugs, and other single-use items garner one item, plus one extra for every degree of success on the test beyond the first.\n\nEach time a character makes a Requisition test to acquire an item with a negative Availability modifier, the group's Subtlety value is decreased by a number equal to the tens digit of that availability modifier. Thus, a Requisition test to acquire an item with the Scarce (–20) availability modifier decreases the group's Subtlety by 2, even if the attempt was unsuccessful. Other tests can impact Subtlety at the GM's discretion, such as in highly conspicuous settings or when dealing with infamous merchants. Each test should also take time to conduct, with the Acolyte relating what means he is using and where he is going. The GM can then apply a realistic time for the attempt to prevent the warband from spending undue time acquiring items during their investigations and adventures.\n\n### Location Modifiers\n\nThe worlds of the Imperium are infinitely varied, and what is available on a crowded hive world can be very different from what is available on a backwater feral world. Some items might be impossible to obtain on certain worlds or locations. Lasguns, for example, are commonly used across the Imperium, but an Acolyte might not be able to find a working las power cell on a remote feral world. The GM can apply modifiers to the Requisition test based on the economy and trade network of the current location, including native creeds and technological conditions. In cases where the character is not near any source from which he could acquire the item or service, the GM can even simply disallow the Requisition test.\n\n### Trading in Items\n\nWhen attempting to obtain an item or service, any bargaining chip is helpful. When a character is making a Requisition test, he can offer up one item he has in his possession to trade in, making the test easier. The item selected to trade must have an availability lower than the item being requisitioned. For example, if the item being requisitioned has an availability of –20, the traded in item must have an availability of –30 or below.\n\nWhen trading in an item this way, the character gets a bonus to his Requisition test equal to the difference between the two items' availabilities. For example, if the item being requisitioned has an availability of –10, and the item being traded in has an Availability of –30, the character gains a +20 bonus to his Requisition test.\n\nIf the Requisition test succeeds, the offered item is traded away, and lost. If the test fails, however, the item is not traded, and the character keeps it.\n\n### \"The Emperor Provides...\"\n\nA player might decide that it is in his character's best interest to focus his skills so that he is better suited for acquiring equipment. In this way, one Acolyte could be the main negotiator for obtaining unusual items for the warband, or for bartering for any extra gear. A character who chooses to develop himself in this way would likely seek to advance his Commerce skill and Fellowship characteristic. Following this path, the warband improves its odds of having access to the most appropriate gear for its investigation, and might even acquire a few luxuries along the way.\n\nAny time that a character seeks to obtain an item, he begins by identifying the person or group most likely to provide it. Once he has done so, he can engage in a Challenging (+0) Opposed Commerce test. For every degree of success on the test, the Acolyte receives a +10 bonus to his Requisition test to obtain an item. Three or more degrees of failure, however, imposes a –10 penalty on the test and could possibly impact the warband's Subtlety.\n\n## Upkeep Tests\n\nEven after the Explorers have acquired an item, it may still be a drain on the resources of the dynasty—requiring fuel to run, dues to be paid, or careful maintenance and repair. At certain times (see below), the GM may require the Explorers to make an Upkeep Test to see if they lose their acquisition or it is diminished or degraded in some way. An Upkeep Test functions in the same way as an Acquisition Test, using all the same modifiers and factors involved in acquiring the original item—in effect, the Explorers are acquiring the item or resource again. If they pass the Test, then their acquisition is unaffected, otherwise they have encountered a shortfall in funds or a waning of favour or influence and must choose one of the following options:\n\n- Discard the item or resource: The Explorers cannot use the acquisition until it is repaired, reloaded, or purchased anew. An acquisition lost in this way cannot be reacquired until the Explorers' Profit Factor increases.\n- Downgrade the item or resource: The acquisition's Craftsmanship is reduced by one level (i.e., Best to Good, Good to Common, etc.). If the acquisition is already of Poor Craftsmanship, then this option may not be selected.\n- Downsize the item or resource: The acquisition's Scale is reduced by one level (i.e., Major to Standard, Minor to Trivial, etc.). If the acquisition is already of Negligible Scale, then this option may not be selected.\n- Overstretch Profit Factor: The Explorers incur a –5 penalty to all Acquisition Tests until either the Explorers' Profit Factor increases or they choose to discard, downgrade, or downsize the acquisition.\n\n### When to Make an Upkeep Test\n\nThe GM can require the Explorers to make Upkeep Tests whenever they suffer a reduction in their fortunes or commit to a massive expenditure of wealth. He can also call on them to make a Test when an item is at risk of damage or destruction. Some examples of when the GM can require the Explorers to make an Upkeep Test include:\n\n- When an acquisition is expended, damaged, or destroyed: Such as a suit of armour worn by an Explorer that suffers massive damage, a planetary settlement bombarded from orbit, or a supply of rare ammunition used excessively.\n- When a rival or adversary attacks the Explorers' holdings or tries to steal their goods or retainers: Such as a mass kidnapping of crewmen on shore leave or when a treacherous adept is skimming off their profits for ship repairs, leading to the forfeiting of valuable components.\n- When fate plays a hand in the Explorers' dynasty: Such as when a hired mercenary company with divided loyalties gets a better offer or there is a system-wide plague that threatens the Explorers' local promethium suppliers.\n\nUltimately, it is up to the GM to decide when the Explorers should make Upkeep Tests, and he should use them as a tool to both remind the PCs that their worldly possession can be tenuous and that there are often consequences for their actions.\n","excerpt":"# Availability and Influence  There is no standard currency across the Imperium, and even in established sectors, few respect the coinage of some far-distant world.

While a trained Adeptus Mechanicus agent, with the proper augmetics is vastly more capable of repairing, controlling, and training these creatures, they are not alone in their use. Anyone equipped with a Constructer Interface can program his Cyber-Construct to obey the vocal (or vox) commands of another agent. This is limited, and cogitation patterns that would normally process evasion and attack movements must instead decipher human speech and intent. To avoid confusion, many users give the beast a designation, commands may be easily addressed, so that it does not interpret random words in other discussion as an order.\n\nIt requires an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test to order a Cyber-Construct to obey the commands of another. This test requires that the user be able to physically adjust the Cyber-Construct, and takes 1 hour. Once so ordered, the creature cannot benefit from the Constructor-Interface until the process has been repeated (this includes uploaded patterns). The following vocal (or vox) commands may be given by users without a Constructor Interface:\n\n#### Attack \n\nThe user spends a Half-Action designating a target that both he and the construct can see. The Construct will then attack the target until it is dead (or sometimes after). Constructs are decidedly ferocious creatures that will not stop until their target is dead or they have been called to heel.\n\n#### Tackle \n\nSimilar to the Attack order, the Cyber-Construct will employ any non-lethal weapons it has to subdue a target. If it lacks non-lethal weapon, it will attack until the target is unconscious (and usually bleeding to death).\n\n#### Find \n\nGiven pertinent data (such as a spoor sample or a pict image) the construct will do it's best to track a target. It will search an area of up to 50m in an attempt to find the target, but will not leave line of sight to the user.\n\n# Cyber-Construct Statistics\n\n## Grapple-Hawk\n\nRarely used outside the Arbites, these exotic cyber-familiars take the form of elegant shining steel hawks.

Common-Craftsmanship vid-relays have a maximum range of about 10 km, while Good-Craftsmanship units can often reach 50 km or more. Best-craftsmanship units can maintain a connection between a planetary surface and a ship in orbit, with only minor delay.

As the user turns on the spot, so does the floating recorder, allowing the user to see kilometres in every direction. With a simple flick of a switch, the recorder zeroes in on the base unit and returns to the launcher in a matter of seconds. Successfully firing a holo-spectus into the air requires a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use test, after which the user gains a visual representation of the area below the hovering pict-recorder out for several kilometres.

Some kinds of armour also have special properties noted in their description. Each type of armour has the following characteristics:\n\n- Armour Type: Describes the type of armour: Basic, Flak, Mesh, Carapace, or Power.\n- Location(s) Covered: What locations the armour covers, which can be a combination of arms, legs, body, and head. Some armour covers all six locations and is noted as covering \"All.\"\n- AP (Armour points): How many Armour points the armour provides for the locations covered. Any non-Best craftsmanship armour that provides 7 or more APs inflicts a –30 penalty on the wearer's Stealth tests.\n- Max Ag: This is the maximum value a character wearing this armour can count his Agility: if the character's Agility is higher than this number, it counts as this number instead. If wearing multiple armour devices (such as a helmet and vest), a character uses the lowest Max Ag value.\n- Weight: Represents how much the armour weighs.\n- Availability: This identifies the armour's Availability, and is used when making Requisition tests to acquire it.\n\n### Mixing Armour\n\nCharacters can wear multiple armours if desired, but the protective qualities are not additive. When an area covered by multiple pieces of armour is struck, the highest AP value is used and all other armours are ignored for purposes of determining damage.\n\n## Armour Modifications\n\nA suit of armour can be a second home for its wearer, and as such, many will seek to modify it to better suit their situation or style. Some might seek out a specially modified piece of armour, or perhaps customise their own. Such changes can improve its fit, or provide protection from the elements. Modifications can be made when first acquiring a piece of armour, or later a character (or an ally) can try to apply them themselves (see Applying Personal Modifications). A suit of armour can have a total of four modifications. Note that the GM has final say over which modifications can be applied; a suit of animal hides, for example, might not be the best candidate for an incense burner.\n\n### Applying Personal Modifications\n\nSome characters may wish to apply their armour modifications personally. If a character decides to do this, he gains a +30 bonus to the modification's Availability when making the requisition test to acquire it. If he succeeds the test, the modification is not applied to his weapon but instead, he receives all of the parts necessary to apply the modification himself. Once a character has the parts for an armour modification, he can use the Trade (Armourer) skill to apply that modification to the desired weapon. This test receives a modifier equal to the Availability of the customisation being applied. If the test succeeds, the modification is successfully applied. If the test fails, the modification is not applied, and the parts necessary to apply the modification are lost in the process. Characters who suffer two or more degrees of failure damage their weapon, and it becomes Unreliable. If the weapon was previously Reliable, it instead loses that quality.\n\n#### Removing and Re-Using Modifications\n\nA character can also recover the parts necessary to apply a modification by removing that modification from a different piece of armour. To do this, the character makes a Trade (Armourer) test with a modifier equal to the Availability of the customisation being removed. If the test succeeds, the modification is successfully removed with its parts intact. If the test fails, the modification is removed, but the parts necessary to reapply the modification are lost in the process.\n\n### Power Armour Subsystems\n\nThe internal power supply, machine spirit, and bulky frames of most suits of Power Armour mean they can support upgrades and modifications that a mundane suit of carapace or flak could not. These upgrades, known as subsystems, do not count against the maximum number of upgrades the armour can support.\n\n## Force Fields\n\nWhile physical armour is often as effective as it is impressive (sometimes merely the sight of a heavily armoured Acolyte is enough to quell a would-be heresy), there are other times where a stealthy approach is required, or the situation calls for a less combative presence. Force fields can provide protection in these instances, as they are usually more concealable and often much more effective as well. Most are small, otherwise unobtrusive devices that none even within the Adeptus Mechanicus fully understand. Some are impossibly ancient archaeotech creations from the Dark Age of Technology, considered holy relics to be venerated and sanctified before each use. Unless stated otherwise, force fields offer protection for the entire body. It is a Half Action to turn the field on or off. A character may only benefit from one field at a time, regardless of how many different fields he may have equipped. When a character wearing an active field is attacked, but before Evasion tests are made, roll 1d100. If the result is lower than or equal to the field's protection rating, the attack is nullified and has no effect on the protected character (although the attack might have an impact on the character's surroundings or other nearby characters, such as with weapons with the Blast quality).\n\nFields can also overload. Compare the 1d100 roll to avoid damage to Table Field Overload Chance. If the result is lower than or equal to the listed number, the field overloads. It ceases to function until it is recharged or repaired, requiring a successful Very Hard (–30) Tech-Use test.\n\n### Field Overload Chance\n\n| Field Craftsmanship | Overload Roll |\n|-------------------------|---------------|\n| **Poor**                | 01-15         |\n| **Common**              | 01-10         |\n| **Good**                | 01-05         |\n| **Best**                | 01            |\n","excerpt":"# Protective Gear  ## Armour"},{"srdPath":"armoury/services","title":"Services","content":"# Services\n\n## Common Services\nThe following services are widely available on almost any settled world in the Imperium.\n\n### Accommodations\n| Accommodations | Examples  | Availability |\n|---|---|---|\n| Low Grade | Hab capsule, grox barn, taproom hammock | Abundant | \n| Mid Grade | Basic hab room, main cabin, quarters, mid-hive hostelry | Average | \n| High Grade | Grand hall lodgings, high berth billet, spire suite | Rare | \n\n### Provisions\n| Provisions | Examples  | Availability |\n|---|---|---|\n| Low Grade | Stickrats, fungus loaf, void | Abundant | \n| Mid Grade | sweat ale | Average | \n| High Grade | Vatmeal cakes, grox stew, | Rare | \n\n### Planetary Transport\n| Transportation | Examples  | Availability | \n|---|---|---|\n| Low Grade | Rickshaw, dust sailer, hab conveyer | Abundant | \n| Mid Grade | Basic autocarriage, short-range, cutter, intra-hive tramway | Average | \n| High Grade | Orbital shuttle, dedicated, autocarriage with driver, furnished palanquin | Rare | \n\n### Interplanetary Transport\n| Ship Type | Availability |\n|---|---|\n| Bulk transport | Abundant | \n| Passenger ship | Plentiful | \n| Pilgrim ship | Common | \n| System ship (intra-system only) | Average | \n| Tramp freighter | Average | \n| Void jumper (nearby systems only) | Scarce | \n\n### Medical Care\n| Medical Care | Example | Availability | EFFECT |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Poor | Underhive bonecutter | Average | Int 30, Medicae skill +0 (rank 1) |\n| Standard | Factory medic | Scarce | Int 40, Medicae skill +0 (rank 1) |\n| Good | Trained medicae, med-servitor | Rare | Int 50, Medicae skill +10 (rank 2) |\n| Excellent | Spire Medicae | Very Rare | Int 60, Medicae skill +20 (rank 3) |\n\n## Rare Services\nThe following services are available only to a select few in the Imperium.

Part weapon system and part cybernetic implant, the user's potentia coil powers the weapon, giving it a near-endless amount of energy to draw from. This removes the usual logistical problems most Guard regiments encounter. Rarely seen on the Spinward Front, these arcane weapons have left a fearsome impression on those Guardsmen lucky enough to have served the Crimson Guard.\n\n## Integrated Weapons Rules\n\nIntegrated Weapons link to and draw power from the potentia coil (see the Mechanicus Implants Trait), and as such only those that possess this implant may use this type of weapon. Whenever an integrated weapon would suffer a Jam the user instead takes 1 Level of Fatigue as the drain on their own potentia coil starts to wear them down.\n\nIntegrated weapons are always physically linked to their user, and cannot be dropped or discarded without first being disconnected. Disconnecting and reconnecting requires an Ordinary (+10) Tech-Use Test and is a Half Action with the Concentration Subtype.\n\nTo use integrated weapons, a character must have Exotic Weapon Training (Integrated Weapons), in addition to any other Weapon Training talents for the base weapon's group.\n\n### Creating Integrated Weapons\n\nIn addition to the effects listed above, certain kinds of weapons gain additional benefits when made into Integrated Weapons, as detailed below:\n\n- Integrated las weapons have unlimited ammunition and never need to reload.\n- Integrated flame, plasma, and melta weapons double their standard Clip Size. Additionally, integrated plasma weapons can still Overheat, but lose the Recharge Quality as long as they remain connected.\n- Integrated chain weapons gain the Razor Sharp Quality.\n- Integrated shock weapons inflict an additional --30 Penalty on Toughness Tests to resist their effects.\n- Integrated power weapons increase their Damage and Penetration by +2.\n\nUpgrading a weapon to an integrated weapon follows the standard rules for weapon upgrades except that the character attempting to upgrade the weapon must have the Forbidden Lore (Adeptus Mechanicus) Skill before he can attempt the Test. The components required to create Integrated Weapons are typically only available on Forge Worlds.\n\n### Disconnected Integrated Weapons\n\nWhenever an integrated weapon is disconnected it quickly loses the benefits of its power source. The weapon retains a residual charge, but this quickly fades. Ranged integrated weapons gain a clip size of 1d10+4, and once the remaining shots have been fired it cannot be fired again until it has been reconnected. Disconnected integrated weapons can Jam, and if this occurs they lose all their remaining ammunition immediately. Integrated melee weapons lose all power within 1d5+3 rounds and revert to a low-tech weapon of the same type (eg. an Integrated power sword will be treated as a standard sword once its power has drained). Integrated weapons only regain their special benefits once reconnected.\n\n### Reconnecting Integrated Weapons\n\nOnce a disconnected integrated weapon has been reconnected to a potentia coil it regains all its usual benefits. If an integrated weapon cannot be reconnected it can be manually charged if the character has access to an external power source. This requires a Hard (--20) Tech Use Test, and grants an integrated ranged weapon an additional 1d10+4 shots or gives an integrated melee weapon 1d5+3 additional rounds of power before they cease operating again. If the character attempting the Tech-Use Test fails by two or more Degrees of Failure, the attempt has damaged the weapon, rendering it useless.\n","excerpt":"# Integrated Weapons  Rare and scarcely understood by the forces of the Imperial Guard, the integrated weapons wielded by the mysterious Crimson Guard give these red-robed warriors a distinct advantage over standard wargear.

Weapons  † The damage, penetration, and special qualities of these weapons are dependent upon the ammunition used."},{"srdPath":"armoury/weapons/rules","title":"Weapons","content":"# Weapons\n\nWeapons are divided into several groups covering a plethora of ranged weapons, dealing with everything from crossbows to plasma cannons, and melee weapons covering all manner of close combat weaponry. Unless they are of Poor craftsmanship, all weapons come with the appropriate holster or carrying strap as part of their cost.\n\nAll weapons have a profile that is presented using the following statistics, providing players and GMs with all the relevant information needed to use them:\n\n- Name: What the weapon is called.\n- Class: Describes the weapon class: Melee, Thrown, Pistol, Basic, Heavy, or Vehicle.\n  - Melee: These weapons can be used in close combat. When using a Melee weapon, the wielder adds his Strength bonus (SB) to the damage inflicted.\n  - Thrown: Propelled by muscle power alone, these weapons include knives, axes, spears, and the like. Unless they are also classed as Melee, they cannot be used in close combat (or if they are, they count as Improvised weapons). When using a Thrown weapon, the wielder adds his SB to the damage inflicted (with the exception of explosives such as grenades).\n  - Pistol: These weapons are fired one-handed and can be used in close combat. However, when a Pistol weapon is used in close combat, the firer gains no bonuses or penalties to hit for range or targeting equipment. Pistols with the Scatter quality fired in melee are considered to be firing at Point-Blank range, but do not gain a +30 bonus for being at Point-Blank range.\n  - Basic: Weapons of this class normally require two hands, but can be used one-handed with a –20 penalty to hit.\n  - Heavy: Such weapons always require two hands and must be braced in some way, usually either on a bipod or tripod, to be fired without penalty. Equally, bracing could be done using a windowsill or sandbag (or the firer's shoulder in the case of missile launchers). Firing a Heavy weapon without bracing incurs a –30 penalty to hit and prohibits Semi-Auto and Full Auto Burst actions.\n  - Mounted: Mounted weapons are heavy weapons too large and powerful to be man-portable. They require the Weapon Training (Heavy) Talent, just like a normal Heavy Weapon, but must be mounted on a weapons platform (such as Terminator armour) or a vehicle. Some Melee weapons (such as the Chainfist) are also in this category.\n  - Vehicle: These weapons must be mounted either upon a vehicle or as part of a permanent emplacement, and are far too huge to be man-portable. Their complex ammunition feeds, massive scale, and powerful recoil require large support elements, and are therefore often mounted upon a turret. Range: This number is used to determine how far the weapon can be accurately fired in metres. Weapons can also be fired at Short, Long, and Extreme ranges, as described in Combat Circumstances. Weapons cannot be fired at targets more than four times their range distance away.\n- RoF (Rate of Fire): This indicates whether the weapon can be fired either on Semi-Auto or Full Auto, and how many rounds or charges it expends when doing so. A weapon's RoF has three entries to indicate the weapon's firing modes. The first entry indicates whether the weapon can be fired singly (with an S). The second entry indicates whether a weapon can be fired semi-automatically; the number listed describes the number of shots fired when the weapon is used in this manner. Finally, the third entry describes whether the weapon can be fired on full automatic, and how many shots are fired when this happens. Any mode in which the weapon cannot be fired is indicated with a \"–\" mark. Some weapons can be fired in more than one mode. If this is the case, each of its different rates of fire is listed in its profile. Characters must choose which mode they are firing their weapon in before making an attack.\n- Dam (Damage): The damage that a hit from the weapon deals, and the type of damage it inflicts for the purpose of Critical damage:\n  - E (Energy): Using electromagnetic energies, photon blasts, or even arcane power fields, these weapons burn and scar with horrible effect.\n  - I (Impact): Blunt force, brute explosions, and concussive strength mark these devices.\n  - R (Rending): Weapons of this type slice and cut with razor-sharp edges or use whirring chain-teeth to lacerate flesh.\n  - X (Explosive): These items rely on devastating eruptions of energy or metal to blast apart targets.\n- Pen (Penetration): Penetration reflects how good the weapon is at cutting through armour. When a shot or blow hits a target, that hit ignores a number of Armour points on that Hit Location equal to the weapon's penetration value. If this ignores more Armour points than the Hit Location possesses, the hit ignores all Armour and the additional penetration has no effect. For example, if a weapon with a penetration of 3 hits a target with 5 Armour points, the target only counts as having 2 Armour points against any damage the hit causes. Note that penetration has no effect on force fields, but it does affect cover.\n- Clip: How many rounds/charges the weapon holds when it is fully loaded. Should a weapon ever fire more shots than it has remaining ammunition in its loaded clip (for example, from a Full Auto Burst), the excess shots are disregarded.\n- Rld (Reload): How many actions the weapon takes to reload. This is generally Half (for a Half Action) or Full (for a Full Action). Some weapons can take a number of actions over several rounds (an Extended action). The number of rounds is given as a number, for example 2 Full means that reloading takes 2 Full rounds.\n- Special: Any special qualities the weapon might have, such as creating a blast when fired or needing to recharge between shots, are listed here.\n- Wt (Weight): This represents how much the weapon weighs. Unless stated otherwise, this is measured in kg (kilograms).\n- Availability: This identifies the standard difficulty for acquiring the item, and is used when an Acolyte makes a Requisition test. Note that the GM can modify this as needed based on local conditions or other factors.\n\n### Weapon Jams\n\nWeapons can jam through extreme age, maltreatment of their machine spirit, or just plain poor design. An unmodified result of 96–100 on a Ranged attack indicates the weapon has jammed. This means the attack automatically misses, and the weapon cannot be fired until the jam is cleared. Clearing a jam is a Full Action that requires a Ballistic Skill test. If the character attempting to clear the jam succeeds on the test, then the jam has been cleared, though the weapon needs to be reloaded and any ammo in it is lost. If he fails on the test, the weapon is still jammed, though he can attempt to clear it again next round. Some weapons, such as plasma guns, grenades, and missiles, carry extra risks associated with jamming. For these weapons, refer to their descriptions and weapon special qualities (see Chapter V: Armoury). Semi-automatic and fully automatic fire also increases the likelihood of jamming; this is described within the Semi-Auto Burst, Full Auto Burst, and Suppressing Fire actions.\n\n### Weapons and Talents\n\nWeapons require a talent to be used effectively, as without sufficient training they can prove as dangerous to friend as to foe. Each weapon type (Las, Chain, Low-Tech, etc.) requires the appropriate Weapon Training talent for best use. For example, firing a Boltgun or any other Bolt Weapon would require Weapon Training (Bolt). Exotic Weapons are more specialised, and a user must have a distinct type of Weapon Training specific to the individual Exotic weapon. There are always circumstances when a character needs to use a weapon for which he does not have the appropriate talent, though, and doing so imposes a –20 untrained penalty on the relevant test.\n\n### Throwing Grenades\n\nThrowing grenades requires no special training or talents, and is resolved using a Ballistic Skill test including any modifiers (such as range). On a miss, the thrown grenade lands instead in a random direction using the Scatter Diagram.\n\n#### Fumbling Grenades and Duds\n\nWhenever a jam results from throwing a grenade or firing a grenade launcher or similar weapon (see the Weapon Jams), something unfortunate has happened. Roll 1d10; on any result other than 10, the explosive is simply a dud and nothing happens. On a 10, the explosive detonates immediately with the effect centred on the attacker. If the explosive was fired from a launcher, it detonates in the barrel, halving its normal effect as well as destroying the weapon.\n\n## Weapon Modifications\n\nEven with the untold billions that exist, each weapon becomes as unique as its owner in time. Some wielders might specifically acquire a specially modified weapon, or customise their own to better match their fighting style. Such changes can alter its precision, the damage it inflicts, and other factors to make it and its user even more valued servants of the Emperor. Modifications can be made when first acquiring a weapon, or later a character (or an ally) can try to apply them himself (see Applying Personal Modifications). A weapon can have a total of four modifications, only one of which can be a sight. Note that the GM has final say over which modifications can be applied; a sniper rifle, for example, could be too unwieldy for a pistol grip.\n\n### Applying Personal Modifications\n\nSome characters may wish to apply their weapon modifications personally. If a character decides to do this, he gains a +30 bonus to the modification's Availability when making the requisition test to acquire it. If he succeeds the test, the modification is not applied to his weapon but instead, he receives all of the parts necessary to apply the modification himself. Once a character has the parts for a weapon modification, he can use the Trade (Armourer) skill to apply that modification to the desired weapon. This test receives a modifier equal to the Availability of the customisation being applied. If the test succeeds, the modification is successfully applied. If the test fails, the modification is not applied, and the parts necessary to apply the modification are lost in the process. Characters who suffer two or more degrees of failure damage their weapon, and it becomes Unreliable. If the weapon was previously Reliable, it instead loses that quality.\n\n#### Removing and Re-Using Modifications\n\nA character can also recover the parts necessary to apply a modification by removing that modification from a different weapon. To do this, the character makes a Trade (Armourer) test with a modifier equal to the Availability of the customisation being removed. If the test succeeds, the modification is successfully removed with its parts intact. If the test fails, the modification is removed, but the parts necessary to reapply the modification are lost in the process.\n\n# Weapon Qualities\n| Quality | Effect |\n|---|---|\n| Accurate | The weapon is crafted for precision attacks, with perfectly crafted las-lenses or finely honed barrels. This grants an additional bonus of +10 to the firer's Ballistic Skill when used with an Aim action, in addition to the normal bonus granted from Aiming. When a character fires a single shot from a single Basic weapon with the Accurate quality while benefitting from the Aim action, the attack inflicts an additional 1d10 damage for every two degrees of success beyond the first (to a maximum of an extra 2d10). These extra d10s cannot generate Righteous Fury. |\n| Balanced | Carefully weighted, the weapon moves naturally with the user, making his parries more successful. Balanced weapons grant a +10 bonus to Weapon Skill tests made to Parry. Even if the wielder is using multiple Balanced weapons, he only gains the bonus once. |\n| Blast (X) | Attacks from this weapon explode on impact, hurling debris and shrapnel in all directions. When working out a hit from a Blast weapon, anyone within the weapon's blast radius in metres, indicated by the number in parentheses, is also suffers a single hit from the weapon. Roll damage once and apply it to each character affected by the blast. A Blast weapon also scatters when the user fails his Ballistic Skill test when firing it . |\n| Concussive (X) | Concussive weapons strike with a powerful impact strong enough to temporarily knock a foe senseless. When a target is struck by a Concussive weapon, he must take a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X). For example, a weapon with Concussive (2) would impose a –20 on this Toughness test and Concussive (0) would cause a test with no penalty. If he fails, the target is Stunned for 1 round per degree of failure. If the attack also inflicted an amount of damage greater than the target's Strength bonus, the target is knocked Prone. |\n| Corrosive | These weapons utilise highly caustic acids which cause damage to both the target and his equipment. If a target is struck by an attack from a Corrosive weapon, the Armour points of any armour worn by the target in that location are reduced by 1d10 points. If the Armour points of the armour are reduced below 0 or the target is not wearing any armour in that location, the excess amount of Armour point damage (or the whole amount if the target is wearing no armour in that location) is dealt to the target. This excess damage is not reduced by Toughness. A target's armour can be reduced multiple times by the effects of a Corrosive weapon, and the Armour point damage is cumulative. A suit of armour can be repaired with a successful Challenging (+0) Tech-Use test, and an Acolyte who possesses the Armour Monger talent can repair the armour while making use of that talent. |\n| Crippling (X) | Designed for cruelty and viciousness, crippling devices are favorites amongst those who prize pain and suffering. When a target suffers at least one wound from this weapon, he is considered Crippled for the remainder of the encounter or until healed of all damage. If a Crippled character takes more than a Half Action on his turn, he suffers Rending damage equal to the number in parentheses (X) to the Hit Location that suffered the original damage. This damage is not reduced by Armour or Toughness. |\n| Daemonbane | Some weapons receive blessings that give them a level of power against the minions of the Dark Gods, but there are special Ordo Malleus rites that go beyond mere sanctification. When used against targets with the Daemonic trait, weapons with this quality gain the Vengeful (8) quality and their damage is not reduced by the target's Toughness bonus. |\n| Defensive | A Defensive weapon, such as a shield, is intended to be used to block attacks and is awkward when used to attack. A weapon with this quality grants a +15 bonus to tests made when used to Parry, but imposes a –10 penalty on tests to make attacks with it. |\n| Decay (X) | Any living creature that suffers Critical Damage (including Damage from Righteous Fury) from this weapon must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test with penalty equal to 10 times X or perish as it collapses into an amorphous puddle of sludge. |\n| Devastating (X) | If the target is a horde, a successful hit from this weapon reduces the Horde's Magnitude by an additional amount equal to X. |\n| Fast | The size and speed of this weapon makes it hard to Parry. Opponents that would Parry an attack against a weapon with the Fast quality take a –20 penalty on their tests |\n| Felling (X) | Felling weapons make a mockery of even the most resilient enemies, cutting dense tissue and bone with ease. When calculating damage from Felling weapons, reduce the target's Unnatural Toughness bonus by the number in parentheses (X). Felling only reduces Unnatural Toughness, not the target's base Toughness bonus, and does not persist once the damage has been calculated. |\n| Flame | Using materials such as promethium and incendiary powders, this weapon ignites with primordial fire. Whenever a target is struck by an attack with this quality (even if he suffers no damage), he must make an Agility test or be set on fire. If the target of the Flame attack is a vehicle, the pilot must make the appropriate Operate skill test with a bonus equal to the vehicle's Armour value on the facing hit by the Flame attack. If the pilot fails, the vehicle immediately catches fire (see On Fire! in combat). |\n| Flexible |  These are often made of linked metal, rope, or other non-rigid materials that deny defensive counters. They cannot be Parried, though they themselves can be used to Parry an opponent's weapon. |\n| Force | A force weapon relies on the user's mind to unlock its true potential, suddenly turning a sword or staff into a device burning with eldritch energies able to reave tanks. Force weapons count as Best craftsmanship Mono variants of the equivalent Low-Tech weapon. In the hands of a psyker, the weapon also deals bonus damage and gains bonus penetration equal to the psyker's base psy rating (so a psy rating 3 would grant +3 damage and +3 penetration), and the damage type changes to Energy. In addition, whenever a psyker damages an opponent, he may take a Focus Power action (Opposed with Willpower) as a Half Action. If he wins the test, then for every degree of success, the Force weapon's wielder deals an additional 1d10 Energy damage, ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus. Psykers always use their base psy rating when determining psychic strength for this test, and cannot generate Psychic Phenomena on this test. Force weapons cannot be destroyed by weapons with the Power Field quality. |\n| Graviton | Graviton weapons alter the target's local gravity field, transforming protective armour into crushing force. When a weapon with the Graviton quality hits a target, it inflicts additional damage equal to the target's Armour points on the struck location. If the target is a vehicle or cover, it instead inflicts additional damage equal to the Armour points of the facing that the attack struck. Vehicles that suffer Critical damage from Graviton weapons always roll on the Motive Systems Critical Effects table, no matter what location was actually hit. |\n| Gyro-stabilised | A Gyro-Stabilised weapon never counts its target as being farther than Long Range (normal maximum range still applies). Heavy weapons with this Quality reduce the penalty for firing without Bracing to –20. |\n| Hallucinogenic (X) | Where most weapons seek to harm the body, those with this quality seek to damage the mind with exotic chemicals and neurotoxic drugs. When a creature is struck by a weapon with the Hallucinogenic quality, it must make a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or suffer a temporary delusion and roll 1d10 on Table: Hallucinogenic Effects. Respirators and sealed armour provide a +20 bonus to this test. The effects last for 1 round, plus 1 additional round for every degree of failure. |\n| Haywire (X) | A foul affront to the Omnissiah in the eyes of many Tech-Priests, devices with this quality seek to cripple machine spirits and make metal as weak as flesh. Everything within the field's radius, indicated by the number in parentheses, is affected. Haywire (3), for example, would affect an area with a three metre radius. Roll 1d10 on Table: Haywire Field Effects (adding any modifiers from the weapon) to determine the strength of the effect. As the field slowly dissipates, the strength lessens one step in severity each round until it becomes Insignificant (i.e., a result of Major Disruption would become Minor Disruption the following round and then cease to have an effect the round after that). Additional Haywire attacks in the same area do not stack but instead create a new effect that is either ignored if lower than the current effect or replaces the old one if higher. |\n| Inaccurate | Poorly manufactured with often shoddy construction, inaccurate weapons are common in underhive gangs and heretical cults. A character gains no benefit from the Aim action when attacking with a weapon with this quality. |\n| Indirect (X) | Many weapons are designed to be fired in high arcs at unseen foes or thrown from protective cover at charging enemies. Indirect weapons do not require line of sight to their target, but the attacker must still be aware of his intended target's location, either through last known position, use of a spotter, or other means. When making any ranged attack action (Standard Attack, Semi-Auto Burst, or Full Auto Burst) with an Indirect weapon, the attack does not have to target a location in line of sight of the active player, but is made at a –10 penalty and requires a Full Action instead of the normal Half Action. The GM makes the final determination on whether the character is aware of his target's location, and can add penalties to this ranged attack based on how aware the character is of his target. For each hit the ranged attack inflicts, roll once on the Scatter Diagram. The hit instead strikes the ground at a location a number of metres away from the intended target, in the direction rolled on the Scatter Diagram, equal to 1d10 minus the firer's Ballistic Skill bonus (to a minimum of zero). If the ranged attack fails, or if the Semi-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst actions fail to achieve the maximum potential hits, the remaining missed hits—up to the maximum potential hits for the rate of fire used in the attack—are still fired, but miss their target. For each missed hit, roll once on the Scatter Diagram. The hit instead strikes the ground at a location Xd10 metres away from the intended target in the direction rolled on the Scatter Diagram, where X is equal to the number in parentheses (X). |\n| Irradiated (X) | When a character is struck by an attack from this weapon (whether or not he suffers Damage) he must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Toughness Test with penalty equal to 10 times X or suffer 2d10 Toughness Damage. |\n| Lance | Lance weapons focus devastating energy, piercing armour with ease. Weapons with this quality have a variable penetration value that is dependent on the accuracy of each shot. When a target is hit by a weapon with the Lance quality, increase the weapon's penetration value by its base value once for each degree of success the attacker achieves. For example, if a Lance weapon had a base penetration value of 5 and hit with three degrees of success (adding 3x5=15), the total penetration for the attack would be 20. |\n| Maximal | Many energy weapons have multiple settings, allowing the user greater tactical flexibility in combat. As a Free Action, this weapon can be switched between two modes: Standard (which uses the normal weapon profile) and Maximal. When the weapon is fired on Maximal, it adds 10 metres to its range, 1d10 to its damage, and +2 to its penetration. If it has the Blast quality, then the value of this quality is increased by 2 (i.e., Blast [3] becomes Blast [5]). The weapon also uses three times the normal amount of ammunition per shot and gains the Recharge quality |\n| Melta | These weapons rely on intense heat to negate protective armour, turning even the thickest to steaming liquid. This weapon doubles its penetration when firing at Short range or closer. |\n| Ogryn-Proof | The bestial Ogryn that serve amongst the ranks of the Imperial Guard have hands that are not only much larger than those of a normal human, but also far stronger. Most Ogryn have a hard time using them to perform delicate, or even normal, tasks. There are many weapons, however, that are perfect for use by these cumbersome creatures. Characters with the Clumsy Trait can use any weapon with the Ogryn-Proof Quality with no penalty. |\n| Overcharge | A weapon with this Quality may expend three times the regular ammunition usage to gain the Concussive (2), Devastating (2), Overheats (on a roll of 86 or higher instead of 91), and Recharge Qualities. If the weapon already has either the Concussive or Devastating Qualities, then add the two together (eg. a Devastating [3] weapon becomes Devastating [5]). |\n| Overheats | Through inefficient shielding, defective venting, or simply inherent design, the weapon often becomes overcome with the heat of its ammunition or firing methods. On an attack roll of 91 or higher, this weapon overheats. The wielder suffers Energy damage equal to the weapon's damage with a penetration of 0 to an arm location (the arm holding the weapon if the weapon was fired one-handed, or a random arm if the weapon was fired with two hands). The wielder may choose to avoid taking the damage by dropping the weapon as a Free Action. A weapon that overheats must spend the round afterwards cooling down, and cannot be fired again until the second round after overheating. A weapon with this quality does not jam, and any effect that would cause the weapon to jam instead causes the weapon to overheat. |\n| Power field | Power fields form a cloud of disruptive energy, allowing a weapon to strike with terrible force. When the character successfully uses this weapon to Parry an attack made with a weapon that lacks this quality, roll 1d100;  on a result of 26 or higher, he destroys the attacker's weapon. Weapons with the Warp Weapon or Force quality, and Natural Weapons, are immune to this effect. |\n| Primitive (X) | Crude and basic in design, these kinds of weapons, while still deadly, are less effective against modern armour. When rolling for damage with these weapons, any die result greater than the number in parentheses (X) counts as that number instead. For example, a weapon with Primitive (7) would count all damage rolls of 8, 9 or 10 as 7. These weapons can still generate Righteous Fury  as normal, on a damage roll of 10. |\n| Proven (X) | These weapons always inflict massive trauma. When rolling for damage with these weapons, any die result lower than the number in parentheses (X) counts as that number instead. Thus, a Proven (3) weapon would treat any die result of 1 or 2 as a 3 for the purposes of calculating damage. |\n| Razor Sharp | Certain weapons or ammunition types have the ability to slice right through armour if they hit just right. If the wielder scores three or more degrees of success when attacking with this weapon, the weapon's penetration value is doubled when resolving any hits from that attack. |\n| Recharge | Some weapons lack continuous power or ammunition supplies, and each strike drains capacitors or empties fuel reservoirs. When a weapon with this quality is used to make an attack, that weapon cannot be used to attack again until the end of the next round (in effect, it can only be used once every other round). |\n| Reliable | Using ancient and well-consecrated designs, reliable weapons bring glory to the Omnissiah with each attack. Reliable weapons only jam on an unmodified result of 100. Reliable weapons with the Spray quality, or which do not make hit rolls, never jam. |\n| Sanctified | These weapons are blessed against the forces of Chaos. Any damage inflicted by a Sanctified weapon counts as Holy damage, which can have unique effects against some terrible Daemons and other denizens of the Warp. |\n| Scatter | The standard ammunition of these weapons spreads out when fired, ripping apart targets at close range but inflicting considerably less harm from afar. When fired at Point Blank range, this weapon gains +10 to hit and deals +3 damage. When fired at Short range, it gains +10 to hit. At any longer ranges, it suffers –3 damage. |\n| Shocking | Shocking weapons can incapacitate their opponents with a powerful surge of energy or other non-lethal means. A target that takes at least 1 point of damage from a Shocking weapon (after Armour and Toughness bonus) must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness test. If he fails, he suffers 1 level of Fatigue and is Stunned for a number of rounds equal to half of his degrees of failure (rounding up). |\n| Smoke (X) | Rather than inflicting damage, these weapons throw up dense clouds to create cover. When a hit is scored from a weapon with this quality, it creates a smokescreen at the point of impact with a radius in metres equal to the number in parentheses (X). This screen lasts for 1d10+10 rounds, or a shorter time in adverse weather conditions (see the effects of smoke). |\n| Snare (X) | These ensnaring devices use masses of fibrous webbing, adhesive fluids, and other entangling materials to bring an enemy down. When a target is struck by a weapon with this quality, it must make an Agility test with a penalty equal ten times the number in parentheses (X) or be Immobilised. For example, a weapon with Snare (1) would impose a –10 penalty on this test. An Immobilised target can attempt no actions other than trying to escape the bonds. As a Full Action, he can make a Challenging (+0) Strength or Agility test, with a penalty equal to ten times the number in parentheses (X). If he succeeds, he bursts free or wriggles out. The target is considered Helpless  until he escapes. |\n| Spray | Spray weapons use large area-effect shots to strike more foes, sacrificing range for wider coverage. Unlike other weapons,they have just one range and, when fired, hit all those in their area of effect. The wielder does not need to test Ballistic Skill.  All creatures in the weapon's path (a cone-shaped area extending in a 30° arc from the firer out to the weapon's range) must make a Challenging (+0) Agility test or suffer one hit from the weapon. If the wielder does not possess the appropriate Weapon Training talent, targets gain a +20 bonus on the test;  this rises to +30 if the weapon is Heavy and the wielder is not braced. Cover does not protect from Spray attacks unless it completely conceals a target. Because there is no attack roll, they are always considered to strike the Body location. They jam if the firer rolls a 9 on any damage dice (before any modifiers are applied). Due to the inaccurate nature of their design, they cannot be used to make Called Shot actions. |\n| Storm | Firing with a hail of shots, these weapons strike so rapidly that enemies are filled with metal in an instant. This quality doubles the number of hits the weapon inflicts on the target and the amount of ammunition expended. For example, when firing a weapon with the Storm quality in fully automatic mode, each degree of success yields two additional hits (up to the weapon's firing rate, as normal) |\n| Tainted | Permeated with the power of the Warp, these weapons draw out the inner darkness of their wielders. Weapons with this quality inflict additional damage equal to the value of the user's Corruption bonus or Daemonic (X) trait value (whichever is higher). |\n| Tearing | These weapons call on spinning chainblades, serrated claws, burrowing projectiles, and other vicious means to rip apart targets. These weapons roll one extra die for damage, and the lowest result is discarded. |\n| Toxic (X) | Filled with malignant chemicals and fast acting poisons, toxic weapons bring down enemies through virulence and sickness. At the end of his turn, if a character has suffered damage (after Armour and Toughness bonus) in the last round from a weapon with this quality, he must make a Toughness test with a penalty equal to 10 times the number in parentheses (X) or suffer 1d10 additional damage (of the same type as the first weapon with this quality to damage him that round). For example, a weapon with Toxic (4) imposes a –40 on the tests to resist its effects. Some weapons or creatures carry additional effects with their toxins or inflict more damage, as indicated in their individual descriptions. |\n| Twin-Linked | A Twin-Linked weapon represents two identical weapons connected together and set to fire at the same time, increasing the chances of scoring a hit by blasting more shots at the target. A weapon with this quality gains a +20 to hit when fired and uses twice as much ammunition. In addition, the weapon scores one additional hit if the attack roll succeeds by two or more degrees of success. When emptied, the weapon's reload time is doubled. |\n| Unbalanced | Cumbersome, awkward to use, and often heavy, these are usually powerful offensively, but suffer in defence actions such as parrying. These weapons cannot be used to make Lighting Attack actions, and impose a –10 penalty when used to Parry. |\n| Unreliable | A clear affront to the Omnissiah, Unreliable devices represent poorly designed, badly manufactured, or improperly consecrated weapons that are perhaps better than no weapon at all, but not by a great measure. An Unreliable weapon suffers a jam on a roll of 91 or higher, even if fired on Semi- or Full Auto. |\n| Unwieldy | Huge and often top-heavy, Unwieldy weapons are too awkward to be used with finesse. They cannot be used to Parry or make Lightning Attack actions. |\n| Warp Weapon | Warp weapons ignore Armour and the AP generated from cover. Force fields and armour specially warded work normally against them. |\n| Vengeful (X) | These weapons seemingly embody the Emperor's wrath, and eagerly strike down any who would stand against His servants. When attacking with this weapon, the attacker triggers Righteous Fury on any damage die result with a value of X or higher (before any modifiers are applied). |\n\n## Hallucinogenic Effects\n\n| Roll | Effect | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| 1 | Bugsbugsbugsbugs! | The character drops to the floor, flailing and screaming as he tries to claw off imaginary insects devouring his skin and flesh. The character gains the Prone and Stunned conditions. |\n| 2 | My hands...! | The character believes his hands have turned into slimy tentacles, or perhaps the flesh has begun to strip off the bone in bloody lumps. Regardless of the particulars, the character drops everything he is carrying and spends the duration staring at his hands and screaming. The character is Stunned. |\n| 3 | They're coming through the walls! | The character sees gruesome aliens bursting through the walls/ceiling/floor/bushes and opens fire. The character must spend each turn firing at a random piece of terrain within his line of sight. Any creatures caught in the line of fire are subject to attacks as normal. Each round, choose a new target at random (use the Scatter Diagram) to determine which direction that is, with a \"7\" meaning he shoots the ground, and a \"10\" meaning he fires wildly into the air. |\n| 4 | Nobody can see me! | The character believes he is invisible and wanders aimlessly, making faces at those around him. He waddles about in random directions each round (use the Scatter Diagram), using a Full Action to move. The character retains his Reactions. |\n| 5 | I can fly! | The sky looks so big and inviting, the character flaps his arms trying to imitate a pterasquirrel. He might do nothing but jump up and down on the spot. If he is standing above ground level, he may throw himself off in a random direction, with the usual consequences for falling—appalling injury or death being the likely outcomes. |\n| 6 | They've got it in for me...! | The character is overcome with paranoia, believing even his own comrades are out to get him. On the character's turn, he must move to a position of cover, getting out of line of sight from any other characters. He remains hidden until the effect ends, moving to new cover as needed to stay as hidden as possible. |\n| 7 | They got me! | The character believes that the gas is toxic and collapses to the floor as if dead;  he counts as being Helpless. Other characters who sees him \"die\" must pass a Challenging (+0) Intelligence test;  should they fail then they also think the character is dead. |\n| 8 | I'll take you all on! | The character is filled with a burning rage and a desire for violence. The character becomes Frenzied  for the duration of the effects, and must attack the closest opponent. |\n| 9 | I'm only little! | The character believes he has shrunk to half his normal size and everything else is big and frightening now. All other characters count as having the Fear (3) trait to the character. |\n| 10 | The worms! | The character desperately tries to remove a massive fanged worm he thinks is slowly winding its way up his leg. If holding a gun, he shoots himself with it or, if not, he hits himself in the leg with whatever melee weapon he is holding. If the character is currently holding no weapon, he draws a random weapon from those he carries and attacks himself with it. Randomly determine which leg the character believes to be trapped by the worm. The attack automatically inflicts a single hit with 1d5 degrees of success that deals damage normally. |\n\n## Haywire Field Effects\n\n| Roll | Effect | Description |\n| 1–2 | Insignificant | Though some machine spirits are unsettled, there is no noticeable effect on nearby technology. |\n| 3–4 | Minor Disruption | All actions utilising powered technology, including firing ranged weapons without the Primitive quality, Tech-Use tests, and any physical actions attempted while wearing power armour or employing cybernetics, suffer a –10 penalty. The base movement of anyone in power armour is reduced by 1. |\n| 5–6 | Major Disruption | All actions utilising technology, including firing ranged weapons without the Primitive quality, Tech-Use tests, and any physical actions attempted while wearing power armour or employing cybernetics, suffer a –20 penalty. The base movement of anyone in power armour is reduced by 3. Melee weapons with technological components function as a Primitive weapon of the analogous type. |\n| 7–8 | Dead Zone | Technology within the affected area completely ceases to function. Power armour becomes unpowered, reducing the wearer's move to 1. Characters with cybernetic replacements to any internal organ(s) suffer one level of Fatigue each round they remain in the Dead Zone. Melee weapons with technological components (i.e. power swords) function as a Low-Tech weapon of their type. |\n| 9–10 | Prolonged Dead Zone | As Dead Zone, but lasting for 1d5 rounds before lessening to a Major Disruption (and then dissipating as normal). |\n","excerpt":"# Weapons  Weapons are divided into several groups covering a plethora of ranged weapons, dealing with everything from crossbows to plasma cannons, and melee weapons covering all manner of close combat weaponry.

Encounters with Daemons, dark rituals, and even the knowledge that such things are possible are all paths to corruption\\. The swirling tempest of psychoactive energies and pseudo\\-matter that makes up the fabric of Warp\\-space is more deadly than any radiation\\. It can instantly destroy, but it can also effect hideous transformations on material, body, and mind, far beyond anything found in a sane universe\\. To most, corruption is a doom to be avoided at all costs, but some, once they find themselves walking the path to damnation, will seek to embrace the darkness\\.\n\n## Corruption Points\n\nCorruption points \\(CP\\) operate much like Insanity points, except they are gained through exposure to the Warp, dark rituals, cursed artefacts, and daemonic influence\\. A PC begins the game with 0 Corruption Points and gains more over time as damage is done to the purity of his soul. The more Corruption points a character has, the more afflicted he becomes; this is reflected in the rules by the risk of Malignancies and Mutation\\. Should CP ever reach 100, the character is either executed by the Inquisition for their moral failing, so horribly mutated that they can no longer function, or flees from light of the Emperor and becomes a servant of Chaos\\. In any case they must be retired from play\\.\n\n### The Corruption Track\n__CP Total__|__Degree Of Corruption__|__Malignancy Test__|__Mutation__   \n--------|--------------------|---------------|-----------\n01–30   |Tainted             |0              |—          \n31–60   |Soiled              |–10            |First Test \n61–90   |Debased             |–20            |Second Test\n91–99   |Profane             |–30            |Third Test \n100+    |Damned              |               |           \n\n## Moral Threats\n\nThe exact level of Corruption points inflicted by a particular event, revelation, or encounter is determined by the GM\\. The following examples can act as guidelines:\n\n#### Warp Shock\n\nIf the character suffers Insanity points resulting from a failed Fear test involving a Warp entity, he suffers a number of Corruption points equal to the being's Fear rating\\. Fear \\(2\\), for example, would mean the Acolyte gains 2 CP\\.\n\n#### Rending the Veil\n\nCharacters caught in a full\\-blown intrusion of the Warp into corporeal reality gain Corruption points from the experience\\. The severity of the Warp breach affects how many Corruption points Acolytes exposed to it suffer \\(1d5 for a minor Warp intrusion, or 1d10 or more for a larger tear in reality\\)\\.\n\n#### Sorcery\n\nPracticing sorcery, witnessing dread rituals, or invoking even the least of Daemons are all causes of Corruption\\. Minor sorcerous rituals inflict 1d5 Corruption points, while larger rituals inflict 1d10 or more\\.\n\n#### Blasphemous Lore\n\nKnowledge itself can corrupt\\. The study of certain foul tomes, malignant texts, or ancient pict\\-logs can cause an Acolyte to gain Corruption points even if he does not comprehend the unholy words or images\\.\n\n#### Dark Deeds\n\nEvil acts done in the furtherance of a malignancy, in pursuit of forbidden lore, or to appease a Daemon always cause the perpetrator to gain 1d5 or 1d10 Corruption points, depending on the actions or Daemon involved\\.\n\n#### Profane Relics\n\nChaos devices and amulets are steeped with terrible energies\\. Merely handling a rune\\-encrusted weapon or wearing gore\\-soaked armour that a servant of the Ruinous Powers once used can corrupt\\. Minor instances should inflict 1d5 Corruption points, while prolonged use can inflict 1d10 or more\\.\n\n#### Vile Persuasion\n\nMany Daemons and cult leaders are masters of insidious temptation and of sowing the seeds of doubt in a faithful heart\\. Their words and arguments can corrupt where force alone would fail\\. Holding an extended conversation with such a being, or losing Opposed Social tests against him, can inflict 1d5 or more Corruption points on a character, at the GM's discretion\\.\n\n## The Malignancy Test\n\nFor every 10 total Corruption points a character gains, he must make a Willpower test to see if his Corruption has manifested as literal damage to his body and soul\\. This roll is modified depending on the number of CP the character already possesses as noted on The Corruption Track\\. If the character fails the test, his spiritual Corruption is given form\\. These metaphysical and psychosomatic scars are called Malignancies, and are randomly rolled on Table Malignancies\\. If a player rolls a result that he has previously suffered for failing a previous Malignancy test, he must roll again until he receives a new result\\.\n\n### Malignancies\nD100 | Malignancy |Effect\n------------------------|------------------------\n01–10 | Palsy |The character suffers from numerous minor tics, shakes, and tremors with no medical cause. Reduce his Agility by 1d10.\n11–15 | Dark-hearted      |The character grows increasingly cruel, callous, and vindictive. Reduce his Fellowship by 1d10.\n16–20 | Ill-fortuned      |Chance seems to mock this Acolyte at the most crucial of opportunities. Whenever this character uses a Fate point, roll 1d10. On a result of 7–10, the Fate point has no effect but is spent anyway.\n21–25 | Skin Afflictions  |The character is plagued by boils, scabs, weeping sores and other disgusting features across his body. He suffers a –20 penalty to all Charm tests.\n26–30 | Night Eyes        |Light pains the character, echoing the growing stain on his soul. Unless he shields his eyes, he suffers a –10 penalty on all tests made in an area of bright light.\n31–33 | Morbid            |The character finds it hard to concentrate as his mind turns increasingly macabre and he becomes prone to tortured, gloom filled trains of thought. Reduce his Intelligence by 1d10.\n34–45 | Witch-Mark        |The character develops some minor physical deformity or easily concealable mutation. It is small, but perhaps enough to consign him to death if found out by a fanatical witch hunter.\n46–50 | Fell Obsession    |This functions like the Obsession Disorder, but in this case the character is obsessed by something sinister or malign (such as collecting finger-bone trophies, ritual scarification, carrying out meaningless vivisections, etc.).\n51–55 | Irrational Nausea |The character feels sick at the sight, sound, or smell of something otherwise innocuous (such as prayer books and holy items, bare flesh, human laughter, fresh food, etc.). When he encounters an object of his revulsion he must make a Toughness test or suffer a –10 penalty to all tests as long as he remains in its presence.\n56–60 | Wasted Frame      |The character's pallor becomes corpse-like and his muscles waste away. Reduce his Strength by 1d10.\n61–63 | Night Terrors     |The character is plagued by daemonic visions in his sleep. This functions identically to the Horrific Nightmares Disorder.\n64–70 | Poor Health       |The character constantly suffers petty illnesses and phantom pains, and his wounds never seem to fully heal. Reduce the character's Toughness by 1d10.\n71–75 | Distrustful       |The character cannot conceal the distrust and antipathy he has for others. He suffers a –10 penalty to Fellowship tests when dealing with strangers.\n76–80 | Malign Sight      |The world seems to darken, tarnish, and rot if the character looks at anything too long. Reduce the character's Perception by 1d10.\n81–83 | Ashen Taste       |Food and drink taste foul and provide little sustenance to the character, and he can barely stomach eating. Recovering levels of Fatigue takes twice as long for him than normal.\n84–90 | Bloodlust         |Murderous rage is never far from the character's mind. After suffering damage (after Armour and Toughness bonus) in combat, he must succeed at a Willpower test to allow his enemies to flee, be captured, or incapacitated, rather than killing them outright, even if his intent is otherwise.\n91–93 | Blackouts         |The character suffers from inexplicable blackouts. When they occur and what happens during them is up to the Game Master, who should inform the player the details of what (if anything) he remembers on awakening.\n94–100 | Strange Addiction |The character has a near-uncontrollable craving for some bizarre and unnatural substance (such as rose petals, fresh blood, widows' tears, etc.). This acts like a Minor Disorder for Compulsion, but is freakish enough to cause serious suspicion if discovered.\n\n## Mutation\n\nA character's Corruption points total is also used to determine the terrible effects of Chaos upon his body\\. As his Corruption builds, his flesh may revolt, twisted by the Dark Gods\\. Of course, such is the insidious nature of Chaos that it is constantly hunting for weakness in mind and body, testing a character's defences until it can find a way into his soul\\. For every 30 Corruption points a character gains, he must make a test against two Characteristics of his choice\\. *He can never test against the same characteristics twice to resist mutation, and should make a note on his Character Sheet of which characteristics he has already used to resist mutation\\.*\n\nFailure on either test means he suffers a mutation\\. The unfortunate Acolyte rolls a 1d100 to gain a random mutation from Table Mutations\\. Should this give him a mutation he already possesses, he must roll again until it results in a fresh mutation\\.\n\nNote that the GM can alternatively select specific mutations and malignancies, to represent unique daemonic energies or the influences of Warp\\-tainted artefacts\\. He can also choose to simply apply specific traits as a mutation result, especially Amphibious, Blind, Burrower, Darksight, Fear, Multiple Arms, Natural Armour, Natural Weapons, Quadruped, Regeneration, Size \\(increase or decrease by one\\), Sonar Sense, or Toxic\\.\n\n### Mutations\n__D100__                 |__Effect__\n--------------------------|--------------------------\n01–06 Bestial Hide        |The character's skin becomes toughened with layers of thick scales or chitin, and he gains the Natural Armour (2) trait.\n07–11 Unnatural Arms      |Twisted appendages (shriveled arms, hooked talons, or fleshy tendrils) emerge from this character's spine or torso. He gains the Multiple Arms (CB) trait.\n12–17 Sightless Orbs      |This character's eyes become sightless, cracked windows into a soul afflicted with a growing corruption. He gains the Blind and Unnatural Senses (CBx10) traits.\n18–25 Swollen Brute       |This character becomes bloated, his muscles expanding and his form becoming excessively corpulent or disturbingly muscular (or perhaps both). This character's Toughness and Strength characteristics are permanently increased by 10, but his Agility bonus is reduced by 1 for purposes of movement.\n26–30 Deathsight          |This character's mind becomes twisted, his eyes showing him countless possible annihilations of anything or anyone he gazes upon for more than a few moments. Once per game session, this character may increase the damage of one attack he has made by his Corruption bonus. If he does so, he gains 1 Corruption point.\n31–36 Cursed Fleshmetal   |This character's armour and cybernetic implants become fused with his flesh, and even regenerate. Removing any of these items requires a Challenging (+0) Medicae test; if the test fails, he suffers 1d5 Rending damage to a randomly selected limb that ignores Armour. He can make an Ordinary (+10) Toughness test to repair items merged with him, in the same manner as a Tech-Use test to repair the same equipment, but suffers 1 Corruption point.\n37–43 Razor Fangs         |This character's teeth grow long, turning into tearing fangs. This character gains an unarmed attack that inflicts 1d5+CB Rending damage, pen 2. He permanently reduces his Fellowship characteristic by 1d5.\n44–49 Excessive Legs      |This character develops extra legs that support his form, suspending his upper torso above a centauroid lower body. This character gains the Quadruped trait with a number of extra legs equal half to his Corruption bonus (rounded up).\n50–54 Wings               |Massive feathered or leathery wings erupt from this character's spine, and he gains the Flyer (CB x 2) trait.\n55–60 Serpentine Tail     |This character's legs wither while his spine elongates into a serpentine tail that supports his body. He gains the Crawler trait and gains an unarmed attack that can strike for 1d10 Impact damage, Pen 0.\n61–69 Searing Blood       |This character's veins are filled with searing acids in place of blood, though somehow the corrosive effects do not burn his own flesh. Whenever he suffers Blood Loss, the foul liquid erupts and inflicts 1d5+CB Energy damage, Pen 0, to each other character within 1d5 metres.\n70–77 Witch-Curse         |A small stigma in the shape of a maddening rune appears on this character's body, marking him as touched by Chaos. He gains the Psyker trait (or adds 1 to an existing psy rating) and freely learns any 1 psychic power that costs 100 xp or less. Whenever he attempts to use this power, he gains 1d5 Corruption points.\n78–84 Bone-Blades         |This character's bones grow long, twisted spurs that sprout painfully from his flesh on his command. This character gains an unarmed attack that inflicts 1d10+CB Rending damage, Pen 0. Whenever he makes an attack with this weapon, this character suffers Blood Loss unless he passes a Challenging (+0) Toughness test.\n85–89 Cannibalistic Urge  |Blood and marrow become as wine and bread to this character, and normal food no longer sates the hunger of his soul. Once per game session, he can remove 1d5 damage by consuming human flesh. Each time he does so, he gains 1 Corruption point.\n90–92 Corrupted Flesh     |Instead of blood, when this character's flesh is torn asunder, horrific insects, worms, or flitting creatures spill forth. Whenever he suffers damage, this character gains the Fear (1) trait for 1d5 rounds.\n93–94 It Will Not Die!    |This character is touched by the power of the Warp, and fortune twists to keep him alive regardless of the terrible wounds he suffers, as if it is the will of some dark being that resides beyond the veil of reality. He can no longer burn a Fate point to survive lethal injuries. Whenever this character would die, he instead survives by the narrowest margin as if he had burned a Fate point and gains 1d10+5 Corruption points.\n95–97 Warp Gaze           |Whatever this character looks upon burns with the fire of the Warp, and all who see his eyes despair. This character gains a 20m ranged attack that strikes with 1d10+CB Energy damage and the Spray quality. Each time he uses this attack, he gains 1d5 Corruption points. Characters struck with this attack must make a Challenging (+0) Fear (1) test.\n98–99 Warp Regeneration   |Corruption seethes through this character's flesh, sewing his body back together time and time again whether he wills it or not. Whenever this character suffers damage, he makes a Challenging (+0) Toughness test. If he succeeds, he gains the Regeneration (CB) trait for 1 round and gains 1d5 Corruption points.\n100 The Warp Made Manifest|This character becomes a Daemon-like creature, capable of reshaping reality itself at his whim. He gains the Daemonic (CB), Fear (2), From Beyond, and Warp Instability traits. He can also use his Willpower characteristic in place of any other characteristic for any test he is called upon to take.\n\n## Roleplaying Corruption\n\nGaining Corruption should always be a significant event for an Acolyte\\. While Insanity represents his mind failing to withstand the horrors of life in the 41st Millennium, Corruption represents his soul slowly falling to Chaos—the very force he strives to combat—piece by piece\\. For one who knows the hidden, terrible truths of what Chaos represents, there can be no more hideous a fate than to feel his soul's destruction and the terrible future that awaits him\\. As such, this should be an important part of how the player conducts his character\\.\n\nMutations and malignancies are manifestations of Corruption; even when they are not visible or even present, though, the character is always suffering, as his soul is being rent apart in spiritual torment\\. A player should not wait for actual mutations or malignancies to occur before looking for ways to represent even slight accumulations of Corruption\\. It might start with subtle fears towards situations or objects similar to what caused him to gain the Corruption, or increasing self\\-loathing for lacking the moral strength to resist Chaos\\. His character could become increasingly defeatist, paranoid, and suspicious, or might even unconsciously seek out other opportunities to gain further Corruption as his soul slowly slides into blackness\\. Working with the GM, the player can use these to develop his character's personality and fate in ways to best reflect the terrors of this nightmare future\\.\n\n## Removing Corruption\n\nThe insidious touch of the Ruinous Powers represents a permanent taint on the soul, and is normally impossible to remove\\. It is this permanence that makes Chaos so difficult to combat, for once it is within someone, it grows and festers like a tainted wound\\. It is possible though, in very rare situations, for the effects of corruption to be lessened\\. This is always an extraordinary occurrence, and might happen once in a campaign at most\\. It could represent a visitation from a Living Saint after her shrine was successfully purged of foul cultists eager to perform a ritual desecration, the blessing from an Arch\\-Cardinal for the respectful recovery of a holy relic used millennia ago to banish a Greater Daemon, or some similarly powerful and singular event\\. This can only reduce Corruption by a small measure, usually no more than 1 or 2 points, though the GM can modify this depending on the nature of the event\\.\n","excerpt":"# Corruption  The corrupting taint of Chaos is ever\\-present in the galaxy, and even Acolytes are not immune to its insidious touch\\. Encounters with Daemons, dark rituals, and even the knowledge that such things are possible are all paths to corruption\\. The swirling tempest of psychoactive energies and pseudo\\-matter that makes up the fabric of Warp\\-space is more deadly than any radiation\\. It can instantly destroy, but it can also effect hideous transformations on material, body, and mind, far beyond anything found in a sane universe\\. To most, corruption is a doom to be avoided at all costs, but some, once they find themselves walking the path to damnation, will seek to embrace the darkness\\."},{"srdPath":"character/creation","title":"Creating a Character","content":"# Creating a Character\n\n## Stage 1: Choose Origin\n\nA character's origin is the planet or location where he was born and likely spent a great deal of his life\\. It can determine his physical appearance, mannerisms, and perspective on the Imperium as a whole\\. A character's origin also determines his starting characteristics\\.\n\nEach origin includes the following special rules that are applied to a character from this origin:\n\n### Characteristic Modifiers\n\nModifiers that alter how the player generates the Acolyte's starting characteristics\\.\n\nTo generate a characteristic, the player rolls 2d10, adds the results together, and then adds 20\\. The result is the character's characteristic, and the player does this for each of the 10 characteristics, filling in each result on the character's character sheet\\. The roll to generate a characteristic can be altered by the characteristic modifiers of the character's home world\\. Each modifier lists characteristics with either a “\\+” or a “–” in front of it\\. These affect the roll in the following ways:\n\n\\+ Characteristic: When rolling to determine the specified characteristic, the character rolls 3d10, takes the two dice with highest results, and adds their results to 20 to determine the characteristic\\.\n\n– Characteristic: When rolling to determine the specified characteristic, the character rolls 3d10, takes the two dice with lowest results, and adds their results to 20 to determine the characteristic\\.\n\nThe Player Characters are a cut above the rest of humanity, and fated for a greater destiny\\. Because of this, the player can re\\-roll any one characteristic value when generating his characteristics, but must keep the second result\\.\n\nIf the GM and all players agree, players can alternatively perform character generation with adding 25 instead of 20 to reflect more experienced characters ready to face even greater threats\\. If so, adjust the values when Allocating Points to start with 30 points, and raise the \\+ and – Characteristics by 5\\. When using this higher starting score, no characteristic can be raised to a value higher than 45\\.\n\n#### Allocating Points\n\nAt the GM's discretion, players can instead use point allocations to determine starting characteristics in place of generating the characteristics via dice rolls\\. To do this, the character starts with a score of 25 in each characteristic and then receives 60 points which he can distribute to any of his characteristics as desired\\. Each point distributed to a characteristic raises that characteristic by one\\. No characteristic, however, can be raised to a value higher than 40 in this way\\.\n\nWhen using point allocations, the characteristic modifiers applied from the PC's origin change the starting score of the respective characteristics:\n\n__\\+ Characteristic:__ Starts with a score of 30\\.\n\n__– Characteristic:__ Starts with a score of 20\\.\n\n### Fate Threshold\n\nA value representing the starting Fate threshold of a character from this origin\\. A character starts with a threshold equal to the listed value, but has a chance at gaining the “Emperor's Blessing” and increasing the value by 1\\. The player rolls 1d10, and compares the result to the Emperor's Blessing value for his origin\\. If the result is equal to or higher than the listed value, the player increases his character's Fate threshold by 1\\.\n\n### Origin Bonus\n\nA special ability that a character from this origin gains during character creation\\. Note that the character does not need to meet the prerequisites for talents granted in this stage\\.\n\n### Origin Aptitude\n\nAn aptitude that the character gains based on his origin\\.\n\n### Wounds\n\nThe number of wounds a character possesses at the beginning of the game\\. This is commonly a static value plus a die roll\\.\n\n## Stage 2: Choose Background\n\nA character's background represents what the character has done with his life up until this point, including the previous organisations under which he served\\. It determines what sort of training the character has received throughout his life, what kind of resources he has access to, and who he knows\\.\n\nEach player chooses one background type for his character and creates his character's history\\. He can either draw on the example background for inspiration—creating a new, unique background history—or leave his character's exact story a mystery for now\\. After choosing a background, the character gains the appropriate starting skills and talents, acquires his starting equipment, and gains his background aptitude and special ability\\.\n\nEach background includes the following special rules that are applied to a character with this background:\n\n### Skills\n\nA list of skills that the character starts with at the Known \\(rank 1\\) level, due to his previous life in that background\\.\n\n### Background Talents\n\nA list of talents that a character from this background gains at character creation\\. Note that the character does not need to meet the normal prerequisites for any talents granted during this stage of character creation\\.\n\n### Equipment\n\nA list of weapons, gear, and other items that a character from this background gains at character creation\\. All ranged weapons come with two clips of their standard ammunition\\.\n\n### Bonuses\n\nA special ability that a character from this background gains\\.\n\n### Background Aptitude\n\nA choice of an aptitude that the character gains from this background\\.\n\n### Trait\n\nA trait, or list of trait choices, that this character begins play with.\n\n## Stage 3: Choose role\n\nWhile origin and background determine a character's past, his role determines what he is in the present\\. Each character views the world around him and his place in it in a certain manner, which is reflected in his role\\. This broadly defines how he faces dangers, interacts with others, and seeks to resolve problems\\. His role also dictates what areas of expertise he excels at, and how he grows and learns with experience\\.\n\nEach role includes the following special rules that are applied to a character with this role:\n\n### Role Aptitudes\n\nThe aptitudes the character gains from this role during character creation\\.\n\n### Role Talents\n\nThe talents that a character with this role gains at character creation\\. Note that the character does not need to meet the normal prerequisites for talents granted during this stage of character creation\\.\n\n### Role Bonus\n\nA unique ability that a character with this role gains during character creation\\.\n\nEach player chooses one role for his character, and decides his character's function before and after joining the warband\\. After the player chooses his character's role, the character immediately gains the appropriate role special ability\\.\n\n## Stage 4: Spend Experience Points, Equip Character\n\nIn this stage, each player customises his character's abilities\\. Player Characters start the game with a certain amount of experience points \\(xp\\), usually 1000xp for relatively new characters, to reflect their lives up until this point and can spend these points to increase their characters' initial characteristics, skills, and talents\\. Here, they can also purchase additional equipment such as weapons and gear from the Armoury\\.\n\n### Spend Experience Points\n\nSpending experience points to increase a character's characteristics, skills, or talents is known as purchasing an Advance. The xp cost of an Advance depends on the aptitudes of the character and the relative power of the Advance. See Advancement for more information.\n\n### Equip Character\n\nEach character starts with certain items based on his background, but can also select additional weapons, equipment, and gear as part of his initial creation\\. These represent other accessories the Acolyte brought with him, and help define his favoured combat methods and idiosyncrasies\\. An Acolyte can make a number of selections up to his starting Influence bonus value from the Armoury, each of which can have an Availability of Scarce \\(–10\\) or better\\. For example, a character with an Influence of 37 could make up to 3 acquisitions\\. Note that all weapons acquired during character creation \\(and in regular game play onwards\\) come with two clips of standard ammunition\\. During regular game play, Acolytes use the normal Requisition system for acquiring additional weapons, gear, armour, and other items from the Armoury\\.\n\n## Stage 5: Give the Character Life\n\nLastly, it is time for each player to give his character the unique personality that sets him apart from his fellow Acolytes\\. This stage helps the players define their characters' names, appearances, past, histories with other PCs or important NPCs, and more\\.\n\n### Gender, Appearance, and Personal Details\n\nThe war\\-torn worlds of the 41st Millennium are home to an unfathomable number of different types of people\\. A character can have any desired gender, unless the GM or a specific origin or background would preclude such an option otherwise\\. The same goes for appearance, which should follow any details made as part of the character's creation, but otherwise be open to free construction\\. As a player is creating the appearance of his character, he should keep in mind the descriptions given in the character creation options he has chosen, as those can often give ideas as to how those from that life might appear\\. For example, feral worlders are often large and muscular while the servants of the Adeptus Mechanics are usually covered in cybernetics and the red robes of their order\\. Many hive worlders are pale, having never seen their sun\\. A character from the Adeptus Astra Telepathica could be uncomfortable in crowds, but an Outcast might welcome them as new sources of income\\. These are only suggestions, however, as there is no such thing as a typical character\\. There are commonalities within origins, backgrounds, and roles, and players should look to them to guide character creation, but fashioning characters with their own unique details can be very rewarding and make for warbands that stand apart\\.\n\n### Twist of Destiny\n\nBeyond the choices that have led a character into service for his Inquisitor, that character's strange and twisted destiny has played a large part in his life\\. To represent the effects of this winding fate on the character's life, each character must roll 1d100 during character creation and compare the result to the Divinations Table, immediately applying the listed affects\\.\n\n#### Divinations Table\nD100 ROLL|PROPHECY                                                |EFFECT\n---------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------\n01       |Mutation without, corruption within.                    |Roll one Malignancy and apply the result.\n02–05    |Trust in your fear.                                     |Increase this character's Perception by 5, He also gains the Phobia Mental Disorder.\n06–09    |Humans must die so that humanity can endure.            |This character gains the Jaded talent.

The first time this character suffers Critical damage each session, roll 1d10. On a result of 10, he does not suffer any Critical Effects, though the damage still counts as Critical damage.\n14–17    |Be a boon to your allies and the bane of your enemies.  |This character gains the Hatred (choose any one) talent. If he already possessed this talent, increase his Strength characteristic by 2 instead.\n18–21    |The wise learn from the deaths of others.               |Increase this character's Agility or Intelligence Characteristic by 3. Reduce his Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill characteristic by 3.\n22–25    |Kill the alien before it can speak its lies.            |This character gains the Quick Draw talent. If he already possesses this talent, increase his Agility characteristic by 2 instead.\n26–29    |Truth is subjective.                                    |Increase this character's Perception characteristic by 3. The first time he would gain 1 or more Corruption points each session, he gains that amount plus 1 instead.\n30–33    |Thought begets Heresy.                                  |Reduce this character's Intelligence characteristic by 3. The first time he would gain 1 or more Corruption points each session, he reduces that amount by 1 (to a minimum of 0) instead.\n34–38    |Heresy begets Retribution.                              |Increase this character's Fellowship or Strength characteristic by 3. Reduce his Toughness or Willpower characteristic by 3.\n39–43    |A mind without purpose wanders in dark places.          |When gaining Mental Disorders , the character may choose to gain a new Disorder instead of increasing the severity of an existing Disorder.\n44–49    |If a job is worth doing, it is worth dying for.         |Increase this character's Toughness or Willpower characteristic by 3. Reduce his Fellowship or Strength characteristic by 3.\n50–54    |Dark dreams lie upon the heart.                         |Whenever this character would gain a random Malignancy, he may instead select any one result and gain that Malignancy.\n55–59    |Violence solves everything.                             |Increase this character's Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill characteristic by 3. Reduce his Agility or Intelligence characteristic by 3.\n60–63    |Ignorance is a wisdom of its own.                       |Reduce this character's Perception characteristic by 3. The first time he would gain 1 or more Insanity points each session, he reduces that amount by 1 (to a minimum of 0) instead.\n64–67    |Only the insane have strength enough to prosper.        |Increase this character's Willpower characteristic by 3. The first time he would gain 1 or more Insanity points each session, he gains that amount plus 1 instead.\n68–71    |A suspicious mind is a healthy mind.                    |Increase this character's Perception characteristic by 2. Additionally, he may re-roll Awareness tests to avoid being Surprised.\n72–75    |Suffering is an unrelenting instructor.                 |Reduce this character's Toughness characteristic by 3. The first time that this character suffers any damage each session, he gains a +20 bonus to the next test he makes before the end of his next turn.\n76–79    |The only true fear is dying without your duty done.     |This character gains the Resistance (Cold, Heat, or Fear) talent. If he already possesses this talent, increase his Toughness characteristic by 2 instead.\n80–83    |Only in death does duty end.                            |The first time this character would suffer Fatigue each session, he suffers that amount of Fatigue minus 1 (to a minimum of 0) instead.\n84–87    |Innocence is an illusion.                               |This character gains the Keen Intuition talent. If he already possesses this talent, increase his Intelligence characteristic by 2 instead.\n88–91    |To war is human.                                        |This character gains the Dodge skill as a Known skill (rank 1).

If he already possesses this talent, increase his Fellowship characteristic by 2 instead.\n96–99    |Even one who has nothing can still offer his life.      |When this character burns Fate threshold to survive a lethal injury, roll 1d10. On a result of 10, he survives whatever grievous wound would have killed him but does not reduce his Fate threshold.\n100      |Do not ask why you serve. Only ask how.                 |Increase this character's Fate threshold by 1.\n\n### Nature\n\nOnce a character's appearance has been determined, and the details of his life worked out, the player should have a good idea of the personality he would like the character to have\\. To help in generating a personality for the character, the player can consider the following questions:\n\n#### What Does the Character Desire?\n\nThe eternal fight never ends, but each character takes up the cause for his own reasons\\. Some characters want only to stay alive, or fight to ensure their loved ones are saved\\. Others might be obsessed with power and riches, or the desire to see the sector cleansed of heresy or crime\\. Some might be devoted to Mankind's survival, caring little for individual lives so long as the species continues\\. A desire could be to gain the favour of a loved one, or even simply to relish a moment of quiet peace with a lho stick and a glass of fine amasec\\.\n\n#### What Does the Character Hate?\n\nHatred can motivate many a character in powerful ways, burning his passions and keeping him fighting when all else is gone\\. A character who lost his world to a xenos invasion might be consumed with hate, and eagerly seek out aliens to kill no matter the species or their actual threat\\. Another might reserve his wrath for those who do not worship the Emperor in the correct manner, or for foul mutants who defy the holy form of Man\\. A character's hatred could also be within himself, for a moment of weakness on an otherwise\\-forgotten battlefield that only the Emperor witnessed\\.\n\n#### What is the Character Willing to Sacrifice?\n\nFor many characters, death is the final sacrifice, and to think otherwise is to turn away from the Emperor\\. Some might hold their lives dearly, knowing what might await them when the Emperor makes His judgement, and willing to sacrifice anything or anyone to forestall that final day\\. Others might care little for death, but fear the day their own honour is lost in their pursuits\\. When combatting the Ruinous Powers, the loss of their very souls might be the supreme sacrifice to avert an apocalypse\\.\n","excerpt":"# Creating a Character  ## Stage 1: Choose Origin"},{"srdPath":"character/fate","title":"Fate Points","content":"# Fate Points \n\nAll Acolytes begin play with one or more Fate points, determined during character creation\\. At the beginning of each game session, an Acolyte receives his full complement of Fate points, as determined by his Fate Threshold\\. During the game, he can spend his Fate points to receive beneficial effects, helping him to succeed where an ordinary person could not\\. \n\n## Fate Threshold \n\nFate threshold represents the maximum number of Fate points that an Acolyte can have at any one time\\. Fate threshold both limits the number of Fate points available at any time to an Acolyte, and guarantees a number of Fate points at the beginning of each game session\\. An Acolyte's total number of Fate points can never exceed his threshold; any Fate points gained in excess of his Fate threshold are lost\\. For this reason, it is a good idea for players to not be too stingy with Fate points\\. By the same token, though, a player who spends Fate points too freely could find his character without one when he really needs it\\. \n\n### Increasing Fate Threshold \n\nIt is possible, but rare, for an Acolyte's Fate threshold to increase\\. The GM can bestow an increase in Fate threshold as a reward for a monumental accomplishment, to represent the unfolding of a great destiny, or perhaps in recognition of a selfless sacrifice on the part of the Acolyte\\. The GM should never grant such a reward lightly; Fate points are a powerful resource for players, and a high Fate threshold ensures a character's survival even when facing certain \\(and possibly justifiable\\) death\\. \n\n## Using Fate Points \n\nFate points allow Player Characters to manipulate situations by mitigating bad results or turning a mishap into fortune\\. Among other things, this allows players to take more risks, which makes the game faster and far more exciting\\. A character has a limited pool of Fate points, and when a Fate point is spent, that number is reduced by one\\. Spent Fate points are restored back up to the character's Fate threshold at the beginning of the next gaming session, or possibly, under special circumstances, in the middle of the game session if the GM deems appropriate\\. A Fate point can be used at any time, either on the character's own turn or in reaction to the action of another character\\. Spending a Fate point is a Free Action, and allows a Player Character to do one of the following: \n\n- Re\\-roll a test\\. \n- Gain a \\+10 bonus to a test\\. This must be chosen before the dice are rolled\\. \n- Add 1 degree of success to a successful test\\. This may be chosen after the dice are rolled\\. \n- Count as having rolled 10 for Initiative\\. \n- Instantly remove 1d5 damage from the character\\. This cannot be used to remove Critical damage\\. \n- Instantly recover from being Stunned\\. \n- Remove all levels of Fatigue\\. \n\n## Burning Fate \n\nWhen an Acolyte faces certain death, he can choose to burn Fate in order to survive\\. This is most often a result of suffering a critical wound in combat, but could also be to survive a fall from a great height, the effects of disease or poison, or even the destruction of a void\\-ship which the Acolyte is aboard\\. Burning Fate permanently reduces the Acolyte's Fate threshold by 1, and he immediately loses any Fate points in excess of his new threshold\\. The Acolyte survives whatever it was that would have killed him, but only just\\. Generally, the Acolyte should be left incapacitated and out of the fight, precluding him from taking any further part in the fight, but also ensuring that his enemies overlook him, perhaps believing him to be dead\\. In cases where Critical damage was the cause, the Acolyte should likely suffer all of the effects from that result except for the actual inflicting of death\\. \n\nIt is up to the GM and the player to work out exactly how the character survives the incident\\. In the case of an injury sustained in combat, perhaps a holy icon worn on the Acolyte's breast deflects a blow, or a bullet passes cleanly through his chest, miraculously missing organs\\. Other situations, such as a Warp drive implosion, or being on the surface of a world during Exterminatus, require a greater degree of creativity to explain, and should seldom be without some consequence\\. \n\nA player can burn Fate threshold regardless of the number of Fate points his Acolyte currently possesses\\. Even a player who has spent all of his Acolyte's Fate points during that session can burn Fate threshold; the Acolyte begins the next session with one less Fate point\\. \n\n## Gaining Fate Points \n\nThere are two primary ways by which an Acolyte can regain spent Fate points\\. First, at the beginning of each game session, all characters restore Fate points up to their Fate threshold; in other words, Acolytes begin each session with a number of Fate points equal to their Fate threshold\\. Second, the GM can grant Fate points during game sessions as rewards for excellent roleplaying or achieving a major goal in the adventure\\. Examples include entertaining in\\-character dialogue, taking actions appropriate for the Acolyte that are not necessarily in the player's “best” interests, drawing successful conclusions based on the facts of a case, or an Acolyte risking his life for the sake of the mission or his companions\\. Such “bonus” Fate points are never guaranteed, and are always solely at the discretion of the GM\\. An Acolyte cannot gain Fate points in excess of his Fate threshold\\.\n","excerpt":"# Fate Points   All Acolytes begin play with one or more Fate points, determined during character creation\\. At the beginning of each game session, an Acolyte receives his full complement of Fate points, as determined by his Fate Threshold\\. During the game, he can spend his Fate points to receive beneficial effects, helping him to succeed where an ordinary person could not\\. "},{"srdPath":"character/influence","title":"Influence","content":"# Influence\n\nInfluence is a characteristic, and like other characteristics it is measured on a scale from 0–100\\. Influence represents a Character's reputation, connections, resources, and other factors that allow him to obtain desired results from the citizens and institutions of the Imperium\\. The higher a character's Influence, the better he is able to exert control over others, and hence the easier it is for him to get items delivered, services performed, and other actions taken at his request\\. All Characters start with a certain amount of Influence, which they can increase through gameplay\\.\n\n## Uses Of Influence\n\nWhenever a Character attempts to use his reputation or resources within the Imperium, the GM can call for an Influence test\\. As with other characteristics, there are numerous ways in which a character may utilise his Influence, but some common uses include the following:\n\n- __Requisition:__ When a Character attempts to obtain equipment, supplies, or services, it is his Influence that determines if he has the resources, connections, or funds to track down and acquire or purchase the item\\. This use of Influence represents a Character calling on his contacts, bribing or pressuring merchants, relying on his reputation with the relevant Imperial organisation, or even retrieving the necessary funds from a financier\\. \n- __Social Interaction:__ Dropping the right names or invoking a fearsome reputation can go far in convincing others to reveal information or acquiesce to a character's wishes\\. Indeed, merely invoking the name of the Inquisition is enough to have many loyal citizens falling over backwards to obey\\. A Character can use his Influence to manipulate others into doing his bidding, revealing information, or otherwise offering assistance\\. He can also use this to generate local currencies as needed for bribes or other social actions where monetary lubrication would be beneficial\\. In certain cases, such as when interacting with an individual or organization with comparable or greater Influence, the GM may require this to be an opposed Influence test\\. All this can attract attention if done too overtly, though this can be desirable when the warband desires their presence known in order to flush out their prey, for example\\.\n- __Investigation:__ In the course of an investigation, Characters often need to access resources and information beyond their personal abilities and assets\\. Characters can use their Influence to cast a wider net and expedite the investigation\\. This can include leaning on contacts for information, gaining access to restricted archives, or ensuring cooperation by local authorities\\. Leveraging Influence can greatly smoothen the investigation, though using it too often can attract attention\\.\n\n## Gaining Influence\n\nUnlike other characteristics, players cannot increase their Character's Influence by spending xp on advances\\. Influence can only be increased though a Character's actions\\. A Character's Influence increases as the character succeeds at his duty, or as a result of specific actions the Character takes to increase his reputation and resources\\. The following are some of the most common reasons for a Character's Influence to increase:\n\n- __Connections:__ Knowing the right people can be instrumental in getting things done\\. Taking one's request straight to the best person to act on it, cutting through the layers of bureaucracy and avoiding communication delays, can achieve faster and more effective results\\. Whether looking at a single hive city or a sub\\-sector, the Characters discover again and again that ties of fealty, responsibility, and authority construct a tangled web and an almost crippling inertia\\. For a Character to be able to contact the right individual directly can mean the difference between a world's salvation and its damnation\\. Connections can come from earlier shared experiences, such as common service in the Imperial Guard or aboard the same voidship, or can occur during investigations as a Character meets new people and establishes relationships\\. Organisations for which a Character has the Peer talent indicate strong connections as well\\. It is up to the GM to determine how much Influence a connection is worth\\. Forming a close bond with a merchant group operating on a single planet may potentially be worth a point or so of Influence, while simply having one's name known to the Lord Sector may be worth several\\.\n- __Debts and Favours:__ Perhaps the most effective way to gain assistance from an individual is by calling in a favour or settling a debt\\. Doing so provides an immediate incentive for the person or organisation to act in accordance with the Character's wishes\\. This is particularly true when it is undesirable or unthinkable to explain the reasons behind the request, a situation in which Characters often find themselves\\. By accomplishing tasks for an individual or organisation, or otherwise benefitting it through their actions, a Character's Influence can increase\\. The amount of the increase depends on the power and Influence of the person or organisation, as well as the importance of the task or benefit\\.\n- __Reputation:__ Characters often achieve their wishes by relying on their reputation\\. By accomplishing his duties and performing impressive feats, a Character can increase his Influence as his name becomes known to the great and powerful, as well as the toiling masses of Imperial governance\\. Uncovering and foiling a plot by Chaos cultists, saving a powerful noble from certain doom, or even sentencing a world to Exterminatus are all actions that can raise a Character's Influence\\. The degree of increase depends both on the importance of the action, and on how overt or subtle the Character is in this performance\\. Executing a heretic in a great spectacle can spread a Character's name across a world and beyond, but saving a planet from certain destruction might do little for a character's wider reputation beyond those few privy to the act\\.\n\n### Influence Increases\n__Influence Gained__|__Sample Reasons__\n---|---\n1|Bringing a minor heretek to justice and stopping his production of unsanctified weapons; disrupting a lesser Faceless Trade operation in minor heretical artefacts\\.\n2|Uncovering and purging a coven of xenophilious nobles; gaining the esteem of a High Marshal of the Adeptus Arbites\\.\n3|Saving the life of a Lord Admiral; detecting and alerting a significant Imperial world of a forthcoming xenos attack\\.\n4|Impressing an important sector lord at a formal banquet; successfully investigating and denouncing a radical Inquisitor\\.\n5|Saving a sub\\-sector capital world from certain destruction; banishing a Greater Daemon back to the Warp\\.\n\n## Losing Influence\n\nJust as certain actions and results can increase a Character's Influence, so can his decisions and even simple chance result in decreases to his Influence\\. Reputation is fickle, and Characters must take care to protect theirs\\. At the GM's discretion, a Character's Influence can decrease when something happens to weaken his resource network and reputation, whether through his own fault or due to outside agency\\. The following are just some examples of events that might decrease a Character's Influence:\n\n- __Failure:__ Just as success increases Influence, so does failure decrease it\\. Failing to stop the Imperium's enemies harms the Characters' reputation in the eyes of the Imperium's rulers and leaders, and may also decrease the confidence their Inquisitor has in their abilities\\. In the most extreme cases, failing to stop a heretical plot may even lead some to suspect the Characters of treachery\\. Similarly, when performing a task for an individual or organisation that would result in an increase in the Character's Influence, failure can have the opposite effect, particularly in the case of very egregious failure that harms the interests of the would\\-be benefactor\\. The amount by which failure decreases a Character's Influence depends on the severity of the failure, and how subtle or overt the Character's actions\\.\n- __Excessive or Reckless Use:__ Influence reflects a Character's standing in the Imperium and reputation in the eyes of his peers and betters\\. Abuse or misuse of his authority can swiftly turn opinion against him\\. When a Character fails an Influence test by more degrees of failure than his Fellowship bonus, his Influence decreases by the difference between the two\\.\n- __Sacrifice:__ In desperate situations, a Character may be forced to sacrifice his resources or reputation to accomplish a goal\\. This could mean calling in a major favour, requesting an onerous task of, and thereby alienating, an ally, or even sending allies or servants on a suicide mission\\. When attempting an Influence test, before rolling, a Character may choose to decrease his Influence by 1d5 in order to automatically succeed\\. If degrees of success are important, the Character is considered to have achieved a number equal to his Fellowship bonus\\. Note that in situations where no test is possible, this use of Influence cannot be made: the situation is beyond even the Character's ability, or the item is impossible to acquire\\.\n- __Atrophy:__ A Character must continuously attend to his Influence, lest it slip away with the passage of time\\. If a Character goes long enough without any new achievements to bolster his reputation, he risks his name being forgotten by contacts, his achievements overshadowed by others, and his reputation tarnishing as those who remember his name reflect on his absence from the stage\\. For each year that passes during which the Character does not perform any work for his Inquisitor, his Influence decreases by 1\\.\n- __Reinforcement Aid:__ Influence is also lost when the warband requests a Reinforcement Character fight at its side\\. This represents the Characters calling favours, debts, or other means to have one of these powerful individuals come to their aid\n\n### Influence Decreases\n\n__Influence Lost__|__Sample Reasons__\n---|---\n1|Becoming embroiled in a shoot\\-out with Hive Desoleum Sanctionaries; failing to exhibit the proper decorum at a formal gathering of the sector's nobility\\.\n2|Destroying the sacred thigh bone of Saint Koriel while fighting to defend his basilica\\.\n3|Failing to prevent the minions of the Callers of Sorrow from releasing a deadly pathogen in the lower levels of Hive Desoleum\\.\n4|Commandeering a company of Imperial Guard, directly resulting in the loss of a major world to Ork invasion\n5|Declaring Exterminatus on a world without proper cause\\.\n\nThe loss of Influence represents actual shifts in attitudes toward the Character, or a loss of resources\\. While it can serve as a simple setback, the loss of Influence can also act as the impetus for exciting encounters or entire game sessions\\. If a player wishes to recoup lost Influence through in\\-game activities, the GM should try to accommodate this\\. For instance, a Character who loses Influence because he failed to save the life of a respected preacher could go before the Ministorum to seek atonement\\. This could be represented by an in-depth social encounter, or the GM could use the opportunity as a springboard for a new adventure, giving the Character an opportunity to redeem himself by performing a dangerous task for the deacon.\n","excerpt":"# Influence  Influence is a characteristic, and like other characteristics it is measured on a scale from 0–100\\. Influence represents a Character's reputation, connections, resources, and other factors that allow him to obtain desired results from the citizens and institutions of the Imperium\\. The higher a character's Influence, the better he is able to exert control over others, and hence the easier it is for him to get items delivered, services performed, and other actions taken at his request\\. All Characters start with a certain amount of Influence, which they can increase through gameplay\\."},{"srdPath":"character/insanity","title":"Insanity","content":"# Insanity\n\nCharacters are at the centre of terrible events: battling indescribable horrors, uncovering shocking truths, and engaging in desperate struggles where countless lives and souls hang in the balance\\. Such are the stresses and terrors involved that the slow slide into insanity is a constant threat\\. No human mind, not even one hardened by the harsh rigours of life in the Imperium, is immune to the slow erosion of sanity by the horrors of the 41st Millennium, and Acolytes are no exception\\. These dangers are represented by Insanity points\\. These represent the strain put on a character's mind by his experiences; the more Insanity points, the more fragile his mind has become\\. The cumulative effects of Insanity points are divided into Traumas, which represent the short term after\\-effects of particularly terrible experiences, and Disorders, which are permanent mental afflictions that mark a character's slide into total madness\n\n## Insanity Points\n\nInsanity points \\(IsP\\) begin at 0 when a PC begins the game and increase over time as damage is done to a character's state of mind. The higher the Insanity Points, the more damaged and debilitated a character becomes, and should IsP ever reach 100, the character is either slain by his Inquisitor or fellow Acolytes for his own good, or falls from grace and becomes an enemy of Mankind\\. In either case, he can no longer serve his Inquisitor—he is lost in the eyes of the Emperor and must be retired from play\\.\n\n## Degrees of Madness\n\nA character is classified as having a certain degree of Madness depending on how many Insanity points he has accumulated\\. This classification gives a player a broad idea of the state of a character's mind and how close to the edge he has become\\. A character's degree of Madness also determines the modifier that he applies to tests taken to avoid Mental Trauma\\.\n\n### The Insanity Track\n__IsP Total__|__Degree Of Madness__|__Trauma Modifier__|__Disorder__\n---------|-----------------|---------------|----------\n01–09    |Stable           |N/A            |None\n10–19    |Unsettled        |+10            |—\n20–29    |Unsettled        |+10            |—\n30–39    |Unsettled        |+10            |—\n40–49    |Disturbed        |+0             |1st–Minor\n50–59    |Disturbed        |+0             |—\n60–69    |Unhinged         |–10            |2nd–Severe\n70–79    |Unhinged         |–10            |—\n80–89    |Deranged         |–20            |3rd–Acute\n90–99    |Deranged         |–20            |—\n100+     |Terminally Insane|N/A            |N/A\n\n## Mental Trauma\n\nMental Trauma represents the relatively short\\-term damage to a character's state of mind that he suffers after experiencing a particularly horrific event\\. Each time the character's Insanity point total rises by another 10 points, he must make a Trauma test\\. This is a Willpower test, modified in difficulty by how many Insanity points the character has accrued in total See Reference File\\. If the character passes the test, he manages to cope with his experience without any ill effect\\. If he fails the test, roll on Table Mental Traumas, adding 10 to the roll for every degree of failure\\. This result is applied in the aftermath of any encounter that inflicted the Insanity points\\.\n\n### Mental Traumas\n__Roll__   |__Result__\n-------|-------\n01–40  |The character becomes withdrawn and quiet. He suffers a –10 penalty to all Fellowship based tests for 3d10 hours.\n41–70  |The character must compulsively perform an action (such as fevered praying, frantically cleaning a weapon, etc.) and pays little attention to anything else. He suffers a –10 penalty to all test based on Intelligence, Fellowship, and Perception. This effect lasts for 3d10 hours.\n71–100 |The character is constantly fearful, seeing danger everywhere, and is extremely jumpy. The character gains a +10 bonus to all Perception-based tests and is at a –10 penalty to Willpower tests for the next 1d5 days.\n101–120|The character suffers from a temporary Severe phobia. This effect lasts for 1d5 days.\n121–130|The character reacts to the slightest stress or pressure by becoming extremely agitated. When performing any task that involves a test, the character must first pass a Willpower test or suffer a –10 modifier to the test. During combat encounters, he suffers a –10 penalty on all tests. This effect lasts for 1d5 days.\n131–140|The character suffers vivid and extreme nightmares whenever he tries to sleep. The next day, and for a further 1d10 days, the character is exhausted by a lack of sleep and gains 1 level of Fatigue.\n141–150|The character is struck dumb and is unable to speak. This lasts for 1d5 days.\n151–160|Extremely distressed and unfocused, the character refuses to eat or drink, and looks to be in a terrible state. Reduce all of the character's characteristics by 10 (to a minimum of 1) for 1d10 days.\n161–170|The character suffers a fit of hysterics, and becomes temporarily blind or deaf for 1d10 days. 171+ The character becomes completely traumatized and virtually unresponsive. He cannot initiate actions, but can be gently led. This effect lasts for 1d10 days.\n\n## Gaining Mental Disorders\n\nMental disorders reflect the permanent, long\\-term effects on a character's mind of the horrors of the battlefield\\. A character automatically gains a new disorder \\(or a more severe version of an existing disorder\\) each time he acquires a certain number of Insanity points\\. A character gains one Minor Disorder when he reaches 40 Insanity points, one Severe Disorder when he reaches 60 Insanity points, and one Acute Disorder when he reaches 80 Insanity points \\(these correspond to the character becoming “Disturbed,” “Unhinged,” and “Deranged”\\)\\. Disorders can be selected by the GM, or the GM can allow the player to select one if he prefers\\. A character must have the preceding severity of a disorder for it to get worse, so for a disorder to become “Severe” the character must have the “Minor” version of the disorder first\\.\n\n### Disorders and Their Severity\n\nThe effect a mental disorder has on a character is left largely up to the GM, though the descriptions presented below provide some guidelines\\. If a character finds himself in a situation or encounter where his disorder will be immediately or dangerously detrimental, he can make a Willpower test\\. Success means that he is able to ignore the effects of the disorder for the remainder of the encounter\\. All disorders are rated as Minor, Severe, or Acute, in ascending order of effect\\.\n\n- Minor Disorder: The effects of the disorder manifest rarely or exhibit a fairly weak compulsion\\. Any test to overcome the effects of the disorder gains a \\+10 bonus\\.\n- Severe Disorder: The effects of the disorder are stronger and may manifest regularly\\. There is no modifier to tests made to overcome the effects of the disorder\\.\n- Acute Disorder: The effects of the disorder are very strong and will trigger at the slightest stimulation\\. Any tests to overcome the effects of the disorder are made a –10 penalty\\.\n\n## Removing Insanity\n\nWith the GMs permission, a character may use xp to remove Insanity points\\. It costs 100 xp to remove a single Insanity point\\. A character cannot ever go down a degree of Madness, and so can never lose one of his disorders through this method\\. The removal of Insanity points should be properly represented as time and effort spent by the character in game \\(long\\-term palliative care, prayer, fasting, penance, recuperation in quiet and pleasant surroundings, etc.\\)\\.\n\n## Only the Insane Shall Prosper\\.\\.\\.\n\nThe more insane a character becomes, the less horrific things seem\\. After all, what are the horrors of a blood\\-soaked sacrifice compared to the terrors an Acolyte sees when he closes his eyes? If the tens digit of a character's Insanity points total is double \\(or more\\) a creature's Fear level, the character is unaffected by that source of Fear and does not need to make a Fear test\\.\n","excerpt":"# Insanity  Characters are at the centre of terrible events: battling indescribable horrors, uncovering shocking truths, and engaging in desperate struggles where countless lives and souls hang in the balance\\.

GMs should also feel free to invent their own to suit individual characters and the terrible trials they've undergone\\. Below are a few examples of common battlefield disorders, any of which may progress during a character's development from Minor to Acute:\n\n## Phobia\n\nThe character has a deep fear of a particular thing or circumstance\\. A phobic character must succeed on a Willpower test to interact with the sources of his phobia\\. Enforced or gratuitous exposure to the source of his disorder may incur Fear tests\\. Examples of this disorder include:\n\n### Fear of the Dead \n\nThe character has an abiding fear and loathing of corpses and the dead, and can't stand to be around them for any length of time\\. Perhaps this is because sometimes they refuse to stay dead, or have others inhabit their flesh\\.\\.\\.\n\n### Fear of Insects\n\nScuttling, carapaced things with many legs are the stuff of this character's waking nightmares: faceless, numberless, and hungry, forever hungry\\.\n\n## Obsession/Compulsion\n\nThe character has a compulsion to perform a particular action or is obsessed with a particular thing\\. A character must make a Willpower test not to act in a compulsive way or pursue his obsession when the opportunity arises\\. Examples of this disorder:\n\n### Kleptomania \n\nA character compulsively steals small objects if he has the opportunity\\. Often the character attaches no value to the items, he just feels the need to steal them\\.\n\n### Self\\-Mortification\n\nThe character feels the need to scourge and whip his flesh on a regular basis in order to purge away the sin of his actions through pain\\. This may be tied to a particular event, such as killing or thinking impure thoughts\\.\n\n### The Flesh is Weak\n\nThe character blames the limitations of his own body for his failures and problems\\. He becomes increasingly obsessed with surgical modification and bionic replacement\\.\n\n## Visions and Voices\n\nThe character sees things that are not there and hears things that others do not\\. Acute sufferers may experience visions into which they are totally immersed\\.\n\n### Dead Acolyte\n\nThe character hears the voice of an old ally now long\\-dead, perhaps a fellow Acolyte that he was unable to save or who sacrificed his life for the character\\. At a Severe level he may even have visions of his friend, or converse with him if his condition becomes Acute\\.\n\n### Flashbacks\n\nThe character relives traumatic moments from his life, often harkening back to a particularly vicious or harrowing battle with foul cultists\\. The length and vividness of these episodes varies according to the seriousness of his condition\\.\n\n## Delusion\n\nThe character suffers from a particular false belief that he must act on as if it were the truth, despite his better judgement or any evidence to the contrary\\.\n\n### Invulnerability\n\nThe character believes that he will never get severely injured, possibly through luck or divine providence\\. Such a character would have to pass a Willpower test to avoid taking on a vastly superior force instead of exercising due caution\\.\n\n### Righteousness\n\nThe character believes that his choices are right and justified, no matter the cost\\. Such a character may callously and needlessly send allies to their deaths in the pursuit of a failing attack plan, even when the evidence that a change in tactics is necessary becomes overwhelming\\.\n\n## Horrific Nightmares\n\nThe character suffers from vivid and recurring nightmares, like imagining the outcome of a failed Gellar Field, or being vivisected by masked men while paralysed and helpless\\. After any stressful day, he must pass a Willpower test in order to not succumb to his terrors while asleep\\. If he fails, he suffers 1 level of Fatigue on the following day\\.\n","excerpt":"# Mental Disorders The range and scale of unpleasant disorders that might afflict a character is potentially limitless, and a few examples are presented here\\.

At the GM's discretion, this attack can be used to aim at specific locations on creatures or within the environment, such as shooting a door lock from across the room or disabling a wall-mounted vid-recorder. This attack does not gain the usual +10 bonus for Standard Attacks.\"},{\"action\":\"Charge\",\"type\":\"Full\",\"subtypes\":[\"Attack\",\"Melee\",\"Movement\"],\"description\":\"The character rushes at his foe and delivers a single melee attack. The target must be at least four metres away, but still within the attacker's Charge Move. The last four metres of the Charge must be in a straight line so the attacker can build speed and line up with his target. Once the attacker reaches his target, he makes a single melee attack by making a Routine (+20) Weapon Skill test. Success inflicts one hit on the target. If the Charging character has no weapons or other items currently readied, he can attempt to Grapple his opponent instead of inflicting damage or to knock him down.\"},{\"action\":\"Defensive Stance\",\"type\":\"Full\",\"subtypes\":[\"Concentration\",\"Melee\"],\"description\":\"The character makes no attacks and instead concentrates entirely on self-defence. Until the start of his next turn, the character can only use his Reactions to make the Evasion Reaction, but may make one additional Reaction, and all opponents suffer a –20 penalty to Weapon Skill tests made to attack him.\"},{\"action\":\"Delay\",\"type\":\"Full\",\"subtypes\":[\"Miscellaneous\"],\"description\":\"Instead of acting hastily, the character waits for a better opportunity. When he chooses Delay, his turn immediately ends. Any time before the start of his next turn, the character can perform a Half Action of his choice—even though it is not currently his turn. This later action counts as being part of his turn, though—so, for example, he cannot use it to make another action with the Attack or Concentration subtype if he made one before taking the Delay action. The later Half Action cannot interrupt another character's turn already in progress, and if it is not used before the start of the character's next turn, it is lost. If two or more characters both attempt to perform a Half Action gained from Delay at the same time, they must make an Opposed Agility test to see who acts first.\"},{\"action\":\"Disengage\",\"type\":\"Full\",\"subtypes\":[\"Movement\"],\"description\":\"The character breaks off from melee combat and may take a Half Move. Opponents that were engaged with the character cannot make the usual immediate Standard Attack actions against the withdrawing character as a result of this movement (see the Fleeing and Leaving Melee sidebar for more details).\"},{\"action\":\"Evasion\",\"type\":\"Reaction\",\"subtypes\":[\"Movement or Melee\"],\"description\":\"After a character is hit from an attack, but before damage is rolled, he can attempt to negate the hit by making a Dodge or Parry test. A character must be aware of the attack in order to make the test (and cannot be Surprised). If he succeeds on the test, he gets out of the way at the last moment; the hit is negated and the attack is considered to have missed (and thus no damage is rolled). If the Evasion test fails, the attack connects and deals damage normally. If the attack is a ranged attack, he must test his Dodge skill. If the attack is a melee attack, he may test either his Dodge or his Parry skill. The default difficulty for this test is Challenging (+0) before any applicable modifiers. Reactions cannot be used during the his own turn, so he cannot Dodge/Parry attacks made via Overwatch or when he flees from combat during his own turn, and so on.\\r\\nSome attacks—such as those made with grenades, flamers, or guns firing semi-automatic or fully-automatic bursts—are especially difficult to avoid. When Dodging an area effect weapon (such as a weapon with the Blast or Spray qualities), a successful Dodge test moves the character to the edge of the area of effect, as long as it is no further away than the character's Agility bonus in metres. If the character would need to move further than this to avoid the attack, or is unable to be moved out of the way due to an obstruction of some sort (such as the confines of a tight corridor), then he automatically fails the test. When Evading Swift Attacks, Lightning Attacks, Full Auto Bursts, Semi-Auto Bursts, attacks from weapons with the Twin-Linked quality, or any other attacks that would inflict multiple hits, each degree of success on the Evasion test negates one additional hit. When Evading attacks from weapons with the Storm quality, each degree of success on the test negates two hits. If the character cancels all of the hits an attack would inflict, the attack is considered a miss.\"},{\"action\":\"Feint\",\"type\":\"Half\",\"subtypes\":[\"Melee\"],\"description\":\"The character attempts to use guile and combat training to trick his opponent into a mistake. The character and his target make an Opposed Weapon Skill test. If the character wins, his next melee Standard Attack action against that same target during this turn cannot be Evaded. If the character's next action is any other action, the advantage of Feinting is lost.\"},{\"action\":\"Focus Power\",\"type\":\"Varies\",\"subtypes\":[\"Varies\"],\"description\":\"Use a Psychic Power.\"},{\"action\":\"Full Auto Burst\",\"type\":\"Half\",\"subtypes\":[\"Attack\",\"Ranged\"],\"description\":\"The character grips his gun tightly and unleashes a furious burst of fully automatic gunfire at his enemies. The attacker must be wielding a ranged weapon capable of fully automatic fire to take this action. If the character has such a weapon in each hand, both capable of fully automatic fire, he can fire both with this action (see Two-Weapon Fighting). If he is wielding a Heavy weapon, it must be braced as normal. The attacker makes a Ballistic Skill test with a –10 penalty to his attack; a dice result of 94 or higher indicates the weapon has jammed (see the Weapon Jams). If he succeeds, he scores one hit with his weapon per degree of success. The number of total hits scored in this manner cannot exceed the weapon's fully automatic rate of fire. Extra hits can either be allocated to the original target or any other targets within two metres, provided none of the new targets would have been harder to hit than the original target. If extra hits are allocated to the same target, use Table 7–2: Multiple Hits to determine the extra Hit Locations. Remember, the first hit is always determined by reversing the numbers of the dice result made to perform the test (see The Attack).

The active character makes an Opposed Strength test against the target, with a +10 bonus if he is using this action as part of a Charge action or immediately after making a Half Move action. If the attacker wins, the target is knocked Prone and must use a Stand action in his turn to regain his feet. If the attacker succeeds by two or more degrees of success, he can choose to inflict 1d5–3+SB Impact damage and one level of Fatigue on the target. If the target wins the test, he keeps his footing. If the target wins by two or more degrees of success, the attacker is knocked Prone instead.\"},{\"action\":\"Lightning Attack\",\"type\":\"Half\",\"subtypes\":[\"Attack\",\"Melee\"],\"description\":\"This action can only be taken if the attacker has the Lightning Attack talent. With fury and precision, the attacker strikes his target multiple times in close combat. The attacker must be armed with a melee weapon or be able to make unarmed attacks to take this action. If he is armed with two melee weapons, he can attack with both as per the rules for Two-Weapon Fighting. Unbalanced or Unwieldy melee weapons cannot be used to make a Lightning Attack. The attacker makes a Difficult (–10) Weapon Skill test. If he succeeds on the test, he inflicts one hit on his target with his melee weapon for every degree of success he scored on the test. The number of hits scored cannot exceed the attacker's Weapon Skill bonus. Extra hits can either be allocated to the original target or any other targets the character is engaged in melee with, provided none of the new targets would have been harder to hit than the original target.

The opponent cannot be forced into another character or some other obstacle (such as wall), but can be pushed off ledges.\"},{\"action\":\"Move\",\"type\":\"Varies\",\"subtypes\":[\"Movement\"],\"description\":\"The active character can spend a Half Action to move a number of metres up to his Agility bonus. As a Full Action, he can move up to twice that distance as per Structured Time Movement Table. If the active character ends his movement adjacent to an opponent, he may engage that opponent in melee. If the active character moves away from an opponent with whom he is engaged, that opponent can immediately make a free Standard Attack action against him as per the rules for the Fleeing and Leaving Melee.\"},{\"action\":\"Overwatch\",\"type\":\"Full\",\"subtypes\":[\"Attack\",\"Concentration\",\"Ranged\"],\"description\":\"The active character guards a specific area or target, poised to shoot at an opportune moment. When Overwatch is declared, the active character establishes a kill zone consisting of any general area, such as a corridor or tree line, which encompasses a 45° arc in the direction that the active character is facing. The active character then specifies Standard Attack, Full Auto Burst, or Semi-Auto Burst, along with the conditions under which he will perform the chosen attack. Each any time the specified conditions are met before the start of the character's next turn, he can perform that attack (so long as he is otherwise eligible to do so). This attack occurs the moment the condition is met, such as an enemy entering the kill zone. If it occurs at the same time as another character's action, the character with the higher Agility acts first. If both characters have the same Agility, they make an Opposed Agility test to see who acts first. After the attack is resolved, even if it does not succeed, targets must immediately make a Challenging (+0) Pinning test or become Pinned where they entered the kill zone. If a character on Overwatch performs any actions or Reactions, such as Evasion, his Overwatch immediately ends. Note this does not include Free Actions, such as speech.\"},{\"action\":\"Ready\",\"type\":\"Half\",\"subtypes\":[\"Miscellaneous\"],\"description\":\"The active character draws a weapon or retrieves an object stowed in a pouch or pocket. A weapon or item can also be properly stowed away with this action (but note that simply dropping an item is considered a Free Action).

This makes the character harder to hit with ranged weapons, but easier prey for melee attacks.

Then, as part of the Action the character fires a Full Auto or Semi-Auto Burst (as per the Full Auto and Semi-Auto Burst actions) and expends the appropriate ammo. All targets within the kill zone must make a Difficult (–10) Pinning test or become Pinned. If the attacker fired a Full Auto burst, the Pinning test is Hard (–20) instead. The character does not roll to hit following the usual penalties or bonuses of the Full Auto and Semi-Auto Burst actions. Instead the character makes a Hard (–20) Ballistic Skill test to see if his gunfire has hit anything. A roll of 94–100 on the test indicates the weapon has jammed (see Weapon Jams below). If the Ballistic Skill test succeeds, the GM assigns the hit to a random target within the kill zone, with every extra two degrees of success scoring an extra hit against another random victim. The number of hits scored cannot exceed the weapon's semi-automatic or fully automatic rate of fire, and use Multiple Hits Table to determine Hit Locations against the same target.

Combat circumstances cover any situational effects that have an impact on combat outside of the actions the characters are performing\\. \n\nMany circumstances offer modifications to tests, making them easier or harder to achieve, and often there can be multiple modifications such as fighting in a night\\-time rainstorm, or a muddy field on a high\\-grav world\\. When these combinations occur, simply add the modifiers together \\(remembering that positive and negative modifiers cancel each other out\\)\\. This might bring the overall modifier to a very high number, making the test ridiculously easy or essentially impossible, and in these cases the GM can simply declare the test succeeds or fails with no dice roll needed\\. The following circumstances are some of the most common ones encountered in combat\\. For situations not covered here, use these as a guide\\. Remember, the GM has the final say about the difficulty of any particular test, or the outcome of any unusual situation\\.\n\n| Difficulty | Skill Modifier | Example |\n|---|---|---|\n| Easy | +30 Bonus | Attacking a Surprised or Unaware target.<br />Attacking a Massive (Size [7]) target.<br />Shooting a target at Point Blank range.<br />Evading an attack that has been anticipated for at least one round. |\n| Routine | +20 Bonus | Melee attacks against a foe that is outnumbered three to one or more.<br />Attacking a Stunned opponent.<br />Attacking an Enormous (Size [6]) target.<br />Evading an attack whilst in full cover from the attacker |\n| Ordinary | +10 Bonus | Attacking a Prone opponent with a melee weapon.<br />Attacking from higher ground.<br />Attacking a Hulking (Size [5]) target.<br />Shooting a target at Short range.<br />Making a Standard Attack action.<br />Melee attacks against a foe who is outnumbered two to one.<br />Evading an attack whilst in partial cover from the attacker. |\n| Challenging | +0 Bonus | Attacking an Average (Size [4]) target.<br />Making a Swift Attack action. |\n| Difficult | –10 Penalty | Shooting at a target at Long range.<br />Shooting a Prone target.<br />Attacking a Scrawny (Size [3]) target.<br />Attacking an enemy in melee whist Prone.<br />Making a Lightning Attack action.<br />Making a Full-Auto ranged action. |\n| Hard | –20 Penalty | Shooting into melee combat.<br />Performing a Called Shot action.<br />Dodging whilst Prone.<br />Making an unarmed attack against an armed opponent.<br />Melee attacks in the darkness.<br />Shooting at a target in fog, mist, or shadow.<br />Attacking a Puny (Size [2]) target.<br />Using a weapon without the correct Weapon Training talent. |\n| Very Hard | –30 Penalty | Attacking or Dodging in deep snow.<br />Firing a heavy weapon that has not been Braced.<br />Attacking a Miniscule (Size [1]) target.<br />Shooting a target at Extreme range.<br />Shooting a completely concealed target.<br />Evading an attack whilst unable to see its source.<br />Shooting at a target in darkness. |\n\n\n## Cover \n\nGiven the extreme lethality of weapons in the 41st Millennium, taking cover in combat is often an excellent way to survive\\. When a character hides behind cover in a fire\\-fight, he conceals a portion of his body, protecting it from enemy fire\\. There are no penalties to Ballistic Skill tests made to attack targets standing behind cover\\. However, there is a chance that the shot can hit the cover rather than the target\\. It is up to the Acolyte to decide which parts of his form he is exposing when behind cover, but as a general rule, a character firing around or over cover will have his Body and Legs concealed\\. If the shot would hit a location that is concealed behind cover, work out the damage against the Armour points of the cover instead, with any excess being applied to the target as normal \\(see Cover Examples for a guide to the Armour points of different kinds of cover\\)\\. \n\nIf a Hit Location would benefit from multiple cover bonuses, the character chooses which one he would like to use, and only gains the benefits from that one source\\. \n\n### Damaging Cover \n\nAs attacks strike cover, they can wear it down, reduce its effectiveness, and eventually even destroy it\\. Whenever a hit strikes a piece of cover and deals damage that exceeds the cover's Armour points, that piece of cover has its Armour points reduced by 1\\. Cover that has its Armour points reduced to 0 is destroyed and offers no further protection\\.\n\n### Example Cover\n__Cover Types__ | __Armour Points__\n---------------------------------------------------------|-------------\nArmour-glass, genatorium pipes, thin metal, wooden planks|4            \nFlakboard, storage crates, sandbags, thick ice, trees    |8            \nCogitator banks, stasis pods, standard barricades        |12           \nRockcrete, hatchways, thick iron, stone                  |16           \nArmaplas, voidship bulkheads, plasteel                   |32           \n\n## Darkness \n\nWeapon Skill tests made in darkness suffer a –20 penalty, while Ballistic Skill tests suffer a –30 penalty\\. While a character is concealed by darkness, he gains a \\+20 bonus to Stealth skill tests\\.\n\n## Difficult Terrain \n\nWeapon Skill and Evasion tests made whilst standing in difficult terrain, such as mud, suffer a –10 penalty\\. Tests made whilst standing in arduous terrain, such as deep snow or slick ice, instead suffer a –30 penalty, or an even greater one if the GM sees fit\\. \n\n## Engaged in Melee \n\nIf an attacking character is adjacent to his target, both the character and his target are considered to be engaged in melee\\. \n\n### Shooting into Melee \n\nCombat Ballistic Skill tests made to hit a target engaged in melee combat suffer a –20 penalty\\. If one or more characters engaged in the melee are Stunned, Helpless, or Unaware, this penalty is ignored\\. \n\n## Extreme Range \n\nTargets that are at a distance of more than three times the range of a character's weapon are at Extreme Range\\. Ballistic Skill tests made to hit targets at Extreme Range are suffer a –30 penalty\\. fog, mist, shadow, or smoke Ballistic Skill tests made to attack targets concealed by fog, mist, shadow, or smoke suffer a –20 penalty\\. While concealed by fog, mist, or shadow, a character gains a \\+10 bonus on Stealth skill tests\\. \n\n## Fog, Mist, Shadow, or Smoke \n\nBallistic Skill tests made to attack targets concealed by fog, mist, shadow, or smoke suffer a –20 penalty\\. While concealed by fog, mist, or shadow, a character gains a \\+10 bonus on Stealth skill tests\\.\n\n## Ganging Up \n\nA character has an advantage when he and his allies engage the same foe in melee combat\\. If a group of characters outnumber their opponent two to one, their Weapon Skill tests against those foes gain a \\+10 bonus\\. If a group of characters outnumber their opponent by three to one or more, their Weapon Skill tests against those foes gain a \\+20 bonus instead\\. \n\n## Helpless Targets \n\nWeapon Skill tests made to hit unconscious or otherwise helpless targets automatically succeed with a number of degrees of success equal to the attacker's Weapon Skill bonus\\. When rolling damage against such a target, roll the dice for damage twice and add the results\\. Prone and Stunned targets are not automatically considered Helpless Targets\\.\n\n## Higher Ground \n\nCharacters standing on higher ground, such as on a table, hill, or mound of dead heretics, have an advantage in melee\\. Weapon Skill tests made by these characters with the high ground gain a \\+10 bonus\\. \n\n## Long Range \n\nTargets that are at a distance of more than double the range of a character's weapon are at Long range\\. Ballistic Skill tests made to hit targets at Long range are suffer a –10 penalty\\. \n\n## Missing and Scattering \n\nSometimes, when flinging a thrown weapon, it is important to know where the weapon lands should the attacker fail his Ballistic Skill test\\. When a character fails this test, the GM rolls 1d10 and consults the Scatter Diagram\\. Roll 1d5 to determine the number of metres the item travels in the indicated direction\\. This is also used with weapons with the Blast quality\\. These affect a wide enough area that if the shot goes awry, it might still damage something, even if what is struck is not the original target\\. \n\n### Scatter Diagram\n| | Source | |\n|---|---|---|\n|1|2|3|\n|4|**Target**|5|\n|6-7|8|9-10|\n\n### Scattering in Zero Gravity \n\nThe consequences of throwing dangerous objects in a zero gravity environment can be both amusing and deadly\\. One way of determining exactly where an errant krak grenade floats after it bounces off the bulkhead is to roll twice on the Scatter Diagram, once for the X\\-axis and once for the Y\\-axis\\. If the GM desires, he can make a third roll for the Z\\-axis when a scatter occurs in huge areas with expansive ceilings or multiple open decks, for example\\. \n\n## Pinning \n\nBeing shot at is a terrifying experience at the best of times, and even the most inexperienced Acolytes know to keep their heads down when the bullets and bolt shells start flying\\. Pinning represents a character's survival instincts telling him to stay in cover\\. Certain combat actions or other circumstances call on their targets to test for Pinning; this is a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Willpower test\\. If the character succeeds, he can act normally\\. If he fails, he instead becomes Pinned\\. \n\n### Being Pinned \n\nA Pinned character is busy trying to avoid getting shot, so may only take a single Half Action each turn, though he can take Free Actions and Reactions as normal\\. Additionally, he suffers a –20 penalty to all Ballistic Skill tests\\. If a Pinned character is in cover relative to the attacker that Pinned him, he may not leave it except to retreat \\(provided he can remain in cover while doing so\\)\\. If he is not in cover when Pinned, he must use his next turn to reach cover\\. If there is no cover nearby, he must move away from the attacker that Pinned him\\. A character can make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Willpower test at the end of his turn to escape Pinning, in which case he may act as normal on his next turn\\. If the character has not been shot at since his last turn or is under cover, he gains a \\+30 bonus on this test\\. A character engaged in melee combat automatically escapes Pinning\\. Characters cannot initiate melee combat in an attempt to escape Pinning\\.\n\n## Point\\-blank Range \n\nWhen a character makes a ranged attack against a target that is two metres away or closer, that target is at Point\\-Blank range\\. Ballistic Skill tests made to attack a target at this range gain a \\+30 bonus\\. This bonus does not apply when the attacker and the target are engaged in melee combat with each other\\. For weapons with a Short range of less than three metres, Point\\-Blank range is one metre less than the weapon's Short range\\. \n\n## Prone \n\nA character is considered Prone any time he is lying on the ground\\. Weapon Skill tests made to attack Prone targets gain a \\+10 bonus, but Ballistic Skill tests made to hit Prone targets suffer a –10 penalty unless the attacker is at Point Blank range\\. A character who is Prone suffers a –10 penalty to Weapon Skill tests and a –20 penalty to Evasion tests\\. \n\n## Short Range \n\nTargets that are at a distance of less than half the range of a character's weapon are at Short range\\. Ballistic Skill tests made to attack targets at Short range gain a \\+10 bonus\\. \n\n## Size \n\nSize is an important factor when attacking foes because it is usually easier to hit a larger target\\. All characters and creatures have a defined Size trait, and it should be relatively easy as well for the GM to assign an appropriate Size trait to objects as needed\\. Use Size Table for determining bonuses and penalties based on a target's Size trait\\. \n\n## Stunned Targets \n\nWeapon Skill and Ballistic Skill tests to attack Stunned targets gain a \\+20 bonus\\.\n\n## Unaware Targets \n\nWhen a character has no idea that he about to be attacked, he is considered an Unaware Target\\. Usually, this happens at the beginning of a combat when one or more characters are Surprised\\. Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill tests made to attack Unaware targets gain a \\+30 bonus\\. \n\n## Weather and Unnatural Conditions \n\nWeapon Skill and Ballistic Skill tests made to attack whilst enduring harsh weather or unnatural conditions, such as heavy rain, an ash storm, or standing knee\\-deep in waves of fungus, suffer a –20 penalty unless stated otherwise for that situation\\.\n","excerpt":"# Combat Circumstances   No two combats ever unfold in the same way; each one is a unique experience with different terrain, environments, weather, and a variety of other factors\\.

Alone, such enemies would stand no chance against a Space Marine\\. In large groups, however, they can pose an overwhelming threat\\. Hordes have the potential to harm by sheer weight of fire and numbers\\. The rules presented here are intended to help Game Masters reflect these massed forces that the characters may face in battle\\. It is important to note that not every enemy is suitable to form a Horde\\. The GM should use his discretion to decide whether an enemy can form a Horde\\. For example, it is unlikely that 50 jungle snakes would be a threat, even as a Horde\\! However, 50 Tyranid Hormagaunts will certainly threaten a trained Cadre of Chaos Space Marines\\. When a creature has a Special Quality for its attacks \\(e\\.g\\., Tearing or Toxic\\), the default method is to apply that Quality to all of the attacks for a Horde made up of that creature\\. However, the GM should use his discretion for when the Quality should not apply \\(for instance, if over half of the creatures in the Horde do not possess that Quality\\)\\. Also, certain Qualities for the Horde's attacks can make an encounter with a Horde particularly dangerous\\.\r\n\r\n## Using A Horde\r\n\r\nA Horde should be treated by the Games Master as a single vast creature\\. The Horde has the same profile as the base creature which makes up its numbers\\.  The only exception to this is that a Horde replaces the individual creature's Wounds value with its Magnitude and location based armour with a single armour value\\.\r\n\r\n### Magnitude\r\n\r\nA Horde is a vast number of one type of enemy or creature attacking in large numbers\\. The abstract number of enemies making up such a Horde are reflected in the Horde's Magnitude\\. This represents the Horde's determination and numbers as an abstract value: one point of Magnitude does not equal one individual enemy or creature\\.\r\n\r\n### Horde Traits\r\n\r\nA creature entry may have a Trait listed that has \\(Horde\\) written next to it\\. These Traits represent the way particular creatures fight in large numbers and only apply when that creature is used as the basis of a Horde\\.\r\n\r\n### Attacking A Horde\r\n\r\nA character can damage a Horde by shooting it with ranged weapons or attacking it in melee\\. These attacks are treated as if they are against a single creature even though they may represent mowing down ranks of enemies or scything through many foes\\. Characters must still roll to hit a Horde, but a size bonus should apply to these tests based on the Horde's Magnitude\\. Weapons that can fire on full or semi\\-auto cause additional hits\\. These hits must be allocated against the Horde and not any individual Lieutenants or Masters that may also be present\\. Hordes do not normally Dodge or Parry Attacks\\. At the GM's discretion, a Horde can Dodge or Parry attacks just as a single creature does, representing the attacker still killing or wounding individual members of the Horde but not enough to affect overall Magnitude\\. A Horde's melee weapons are immune to being shattered by a weapon with Power Field Quality when Parried \\(this is an abstraction—in fact, the Horde's weapons are being destroyed, but there are plenty more where those came from\\)\\. Multiple enemies attacking the same Horde do not gain the benefits of Ganging Up\\.\r\n\r\n#### Damaging A Horde\r\n\r\nEach hit that causes any amount of damage reduces a Horde's Magnitude by one\\. Therefore, an attack that, after accounting for armour and Toughness Bonus, causes 15 points of damage reduces the Horde's Magnitude by 1\\. The deliberate consequence of this is that sustained fire and blast weapons are much more effective against Hordes than weapons which fire only one shot; a lascannon is a weapon for destroying tanks, not mowing down large numbers of infantry\\. Weapons that inflict Explosive Damage \\(X\\) gain a bonus against Hordes and count as having inflicted one additional Hit per Attack after all other Hits have been applied\\. Locations are not used when fighting a Horde\\. A Horde has a single armour value that is applied to all damage rather than different armour values for different locations\\. Hordes may be Pinned as normal \\(with the entire Horde making a single Willpower Test\\)\\. However, Hordes gain a bonus to their Willpower Tests to resist pinning equal to its Magnitude\\.\r\n\r\n#### Melee\r\n\r\nWhen fighting against a Horde in Melee, a PC inflicts one hit for every two Degrees of Success on his Weapon Skill Test\\. Melee weapons with the Power Field Quality inflict one additional hit\\.\r\n\r\n#### Blast Weapons\r\n\r\nA Blast weapon that hits a Horde hits a number of times equal to its Blast value\\. So a grenade with Blast \\(4\\) will automatically hit four times if successfully lobbed into the Horde\\.\r\n\r\n#### Flame Weapons\r\n\r\nA flame weapon used on a Horde hits it a number of times equal to one quarter of the weapon's range \\(rounding up\\), plus 1d5\\. So a flame weapon with a range of 10 hits a Horde 1d5\\+3 times\\. A Horde cannot be set on fire and does not suffer the lingering effects of fire; instead, any damage and effects of fire are assumed to be included in the Magnitude damage\\.\r\n\r\n#### Righteous Fury and Hordes\r\n\r\nRighteous Fury has no additional effect on Hordes\\. This is because each hit is only affecting one individual in the larger Horde\\. No matter how brutal the kill, it has little effect on the dead individual's comrades\\.\r\n\r\n#### Psychic Powers\r\n\r\nPsychic Powers that do direct damage inflict damage against a Horde in the same manner as ranged weapons \\(particularly powers with the Psychic Storm and Psychic Blast qualities\\)\\. At the GM's discretion, certain psychic powers \\(such as Compel\\) that do not damage may still inflict “hits,” meaning that portions of the Horde have been convinced not to attack, and so forth\\. In this case, the number of hits inflicted should equal the Degrees of Success on the Focus Power Test\\. Furthermore, the GM should take care to adjudicate the effects of certain psychic powers \\(such as Rain of Corruption\\) in specific situations against Hordes \\(such as a Horde tightly packed into a small space\\)\\.\r\n\r\n#### Breaking A Horde\r\n\r\nWhen a Horde's Magnitude is reduced by 25% in a turn, it must make a Willpower Test when it is its turn to act again\\. If it passes, it may continue to act\\. If it fails, it breaks and flees at its highest move value\\. If the Horde's Magnitude is less than 50% of its starting value, it suffers a –10 to the Willpower Test\\. If the Horde's Magnitude is less than 25% of its starting value, it will automatically break\\. Hordes composed of enemies with the Fearless talent do not have to test to see if they break as their Magnitude is eroded: they have to be wiped out to the last\\.\r\n\r\n### Hordes Attacking\r\n\r\nA Horde can make both melee attacks against enemies in close proximity and ranged attacks at enemies that are at a distance in a single turn as an attack action\\.\r\n\r\nMelee: A Horde attacks all adjacent enemies, or enemies that are in close proximity \\(the GM is the final arbiter of determining if a target is in close proximity\\)\\. A Horde that has multiple attacks from being armed with two weapons or the Swift Attack or Lightning Attack Talents may use its full number of attacks against every eligible target\\. Although a Horde represents a large number of attackers, a Horde does not gain the benefits of Ganging Up\\. Instead, the Horde's sheer weight of numbers is represented by the fact that its target may not Dodge or Parry\\. Melee Attacks made by Hordes cannot be Parried or Dodged unless otherwise noted\\.\r\n\r\nRanged: A Horde may make ranged attacks equal to the first digit of its Magnitude\\. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde can make two ranged attacks\\. Any additional hits from sustained fire can be applied to any eligible target\\. Therefore, if the heretics hit Brother Silas well enough that they cause an extra hit with their stub autos, the additional hit will be applied to Brother Silas\\. Modifiers of range and sustained fire apply as normal, but a Horde can never aim\\. Ammo expenditure and Jamming never applies to Hordes—they always have extra bullets\\.\r\n\r\n#### Damage Caused by Hordes\r\n\r\nAny attack from a Horde that hits has the damage it causes increased by a number of d10s equal to the Horde's Magnitude divided by ten, with a maximum bonus of \\+2d10\\. This is in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon that the Horde is armed with\\. It will also include the Strength Bonus added to damage caused by melee weapons\\. The damage is reduced by the target's Toughness bonus and armour as normal\\. Thus, a Magnitude 25 Horde of heretics armed with axes will add 2d10 to the normal damage that a heretic would do with its axe \\(1d10\\+5\\) and, therefore, causes 3d10\\+5 damage if they hit in combat\\. Likewise, the same mob armed with autopistols will cause 3d10\\+2 damage with its ranged attacks\\. This represents being mobbed with enemies that strike it countless times or bullets striking like rain on a single target\\.\r\n\r\nGenerally, the attacks of a Horde may not be Dodged or Parried—this represents the Horde's sheer volume of fi repower\\. At the GM's discretion, he may choose to allow certain attacks from a Horde to be Dodged as normal\\. For example, a Horde of Imperial Guardsmen may possess a single missile launcher amongst their number\\. Since the entire horde is not firing missiles \\(they are instead firing lasguns\\), the missile launcher does not benefit from the Horde's abilities regarding ranged attacks, and therefore receives no bonus damage and may be Dodged normally\\. Hordes cannot inflict Righteous Fury unless specifically noted otherwise\\. The damage they could deal is taken into account with the extra dice they roll\\.\r\n\r\n## Horde Versus Horde\r\n\r\n### Combat\r\n\r\nOccasionally, there will be cause for two Hordes to face off against each other\\. Whether this is an army of renegades facing Imperial Guardsmen or two opposing factions of Chaos Zealots trying to prove whose Patron is superior, combat works similar to the basic Horde rules\\. Treat each Horde as if they were an individual character and follow the rules outlined above for calculating their Damage\\. When determining the bonus To Hit modifier for size, use the difference between them, with the smaller Horde receiving the benefit\\. For example, a Magnitude 30 Horde of Zealots is fighting a Magnitude 60 Horde of Guardsmen\\. The Zealots would receive a \\+10 To Hit modifier on all attacks made against the Horde of Guardsmen\\. Individual Player\\-characters involved in Horde versus Horde combat have the option of fighting as individuals or fighting as part of the Horde\\. If they choose to fight as part of the Horde, they will still act on their own Initiative, but they may only use Psychic Powers or Daemonic Gifts to differentiate themselves from the Hordes basic attacks\\. A character may choose to leave a Horde as a Half Action\\.\r\n\r\n### Creating A Horde\r\n\r\nTo create a Horde is simply a matter of taking a low level adversary \\(usually a Troops adversary, but sometimes an Elite\\) and replacing its wounds with a Magnitude value desired by the GM\\.  The one exception is any creature with the Swarm rule\\. Swarms are similar to Hordes, but represent groups of even lesser enemies, and the rules do not combine\\.\r\n","excerpt":"# Hordes\r \r The enemies of can attack in vast numbers— howling zealots, skittering Hordes, and ranked warriors\\.

Also, certain Qualities for the Horde's attacks can make an encounter with a Horde particularly dangerous\\.\r"},{"srdPath":"combat/injury","title":"Injury","content":"# Injury \n\nThe life of a Player in the 41st millennium is filled with physical stress\\. Devastating weapons effects, horrid creature attacks, baleful mental tortures, and more can reduce a character to a bleeding lump of flesh in desperate need of medicae assistance\\. Other actions, such as sprinting across a minefield, can also lessen a character's effectiveness\\. Common physical injuries to Players are represented by damage and Fatigue\\. Additionally, characters can also experience several types of conditions and special damage such as fire, suffocation, and limb loss\\. It is important to know how much physical abuse a character can take, and a key measurement of this is how many wounds he possesses\\. \n\n## Wounds \n\nWounds are a measurement of how much punishment a character can take before suffering debilitating effects and ultimately death\\. Every character has a specified number of wounds\\. Wounds do not normally deplete\\. Even when a character is injured, that injury does not decrease his wounds\\. Instead, a character's wounds simply serve as a threshold, and the injury is recorded on his character sheet as damage\\. When a character's damage exceeds his wounds, however, his life is put at risk\\. \n\n### Damage \n\nDamage is physical trauma dealt to a character\\. Acolytes can suffer damage a number ways, including being shot by an autogun, stabbed by an rusted cultist blade, run over by a tank, exposed to the hard vacuum of space, and so forth\\. When a Player Character suffers damage, record the amount on his character sheet\\. That damage remains with the character until it is removed over time by natural healing, or the character receives medical attention\\. Damage is cumulative; each time a character suffers damage, the amount is added to any previous damage he had\\. \n\nEach time a character is dealt damage, there are factors that might allow him to reduce it before it is applied to his total\\. By default, a character reduces incoming damage from each hit by an amount equal to his Toughness bonus\\. Armour can also help further reduce damage\\. If the source of the damage struck a location protected by armour, the incoming damage is reduced by an amount equal to the Armour points provided by the armour\\. It is important to note that some sources of damage ignore Armour and/ or Toughness; such cases are always detailed in the description of the damage source\\. As long as a character's total damage is equal to or less than his wounds, his body still functions normally\\. If a character's damage ever exceeds his wounds, he begins to take Critical damage\\. \n\n### Damage Types \n\nAll damage is divided up into four types: \n\n- Energy (E) \\(lasers, fire, plasma\\) \n- Explosive (X) \\(grenades, bolt rounds\\) \n- Impact (I) \\(clubs, bullets, falling\\) \n- Rending (R) \\(swords, blades, claws\\) \n\nIf a source of damage does not specify a type, treat it as Impact\\. The type of damage inflicted is usually only important for determining Critical Effects resulting from Critical damage\\. \n\n### Critical Damage \n\nWhenever a character's total damage exceeds his wounds, he begins to take Critical damage\\. Each time a character suffers Critical damage, he also suffers one or more Critical Effects\\. These are determined by consulting the appropriate Critical Effect table based on the affected location \\(Arm, Body, Head, or Leg\\) and the damage type \\(Energy, Explosive, Impact, or Rending\\)\\. As with normal damage, Critical damage is cumulative and remains with the character until he either heals naturally over time or receives medical attention\\. Each Critical Effect also has its own duration \\(sometimes permanent\\)\\. If a Critically damaged character suffers more damage, the amount is added to his existing Critical damage and a new set of Critical Effects are applied based on his total Critical damage \\(assuming he is still alive\\)\\. Note that this new Critical damage does not override or negate the previous Critical damage effects unless the two effects are mutually exclusive, in which case, use the most recent Critical damage effect\\.\n\n### Removing Damage \n\nCharacters automatically remove damage \\(both ordinary and Critical\\) over time through natural healing\\. Medical attention and some psychic powers can also remove damage\\. The rate of damage removal depends on several factors and is fully explained in Healing\\.\n\n## Fatigue \n\nNot all injuries are lethal\\. Exhaustion, combat trauma, or swapping licks with bare fists can all leave a character battered but more or less intact\\. Fatigue represents the amount of non\\-lethal injury a character can take over the course of game play\\. Characters suffer Fatigue from certain types of attacks, Grappling, some Critical Effects, and other actions that push them beyond safe limits\\. Fatigue is measured in levels\\. \n\nAny time a character gains or loses a level of Fatigue, he compares his new Fatigue level to his characteristic bonuses\\. Any characteristic with a bonus lower than the character's current Fatigue level becomes “fatigued\\.” Fatigued characteristics affect the character is different ways depending on if the game is currently in narrative time or structured time: \n\n- Structured Time: A fatigued characteristic counts as half its normal value \\(rounded up\\) when the character wishes to perform an action that includes a test that calls on that characteristic, or any other uses of that characteristic\\. \n- Narrative Time: Any time the character performs a task that includes a test of a fatigued characteristic, that task takes twice the normal time to attempt\\. \n\n### Fatigue Threshold \n\nA character's Fatigue threshold is equal to his Toughness bonus and Willpower bonus added together\\. If a character's levels of Fatigue ever exceeds this threshold, the character passes out and is Unconscious for 10–TB minutes; at the end of that time, he awakens with his levels of Fatigue reverted to a number equal to his Toughness bonus\\. If a character's Fatigue ever exceeds double the amount of his Fatigue threshold, the character dies\\. \n\n### Removing Fatigue \n\nFatigue goes away with time\\. Each hour of normal rest \\(but not time spent Unconscious\\) without any combat, use of psychic powers, or other strenuous activity, removes one level of Fatigue\\. Six consecutive hours of rest removes all Fatigue\\.\n\n## Characteristic Damage \n\nSome psychic powers, poisons, diseases and other hazards circumvent a character's wounds and deal damage directly to a characteristic\\. Characteristic damage cannot reduce a characteristic below zero\\. It can also affect the corresponding characteristic bonus\\. Effects of Zero Characteristic summarizes what happens when a particular characteristic is reduced to zero\\. \n\n### Removing Characteristic Damage \n\nUnless otherwise specified, characteristic damage is never permanent\\. A character automatically removes one point of characteristic damage each hour, regardless of his activity level\\. The GM can allow certain types of medical attention to remove characteristic damage at a faster rate\\.\n\n#### Effects of Zero Characteristics\n__Characteristic__      |__Effect__                                                                                                                  \n--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nZero Weapon Skill   |The character cannot make tests based on this characteristic.                                                           \nZero Ballistic Skill|The character cannot make tests based on this characteristic.                                                           \nZero Strength       |The character collapses to the ground and is Unconscious.                                                               \nZero Toughness      |The character dies.                                                                                                     \nZero Agility        |The character is paralysed, Helpless, and can take no actions.                                                          \nZero Intelligence   |The character slips quietly into a dreamless coma, and is now treated as Helpless.                                      \nZero Perception     |The character is bereft of his senses and suffers a –30 penalty to all tests (except Toughness) until he recovers.      \nZero Willpower      |The character falls into a nightmare-filled sleep and is Unconscious.                                                   \nZero Fellowship     |The character withdraws into a blank, catatonic state. He cannot communicate or make tests based on this characteristic.\n\n## Narrative Effects of Wounds \n\nIn addition to the mechanical effects of receiving a wound, some players might want to play out the narrative effects of some of their character's more brutal injuries\\. Perhaps a vicious wound to an Acolyte's leg from a chainsword leaves him with a slight limp, or a scorching blast of fire to the head burns off half of his hair\\. Adding details like this can add to a character's personality, and make important encounters much more memorable\\.\n\n## Conditions and Special Damage \n\nCommon injuries are far from the only forms of bodily harm facing those who fight to preserve Mankind across the scarred battlefields or dark underhives of the galaxy\\. Acolytes can find themselves set on fire, or suffering from horribly bleeding wounds, broken bones, or permanent loss of limbs\\. All of these, and more, are collectively known as conditions and special damage\\. \n\n### Amputated Limbs \n\nWhenever a character loses a limb \\(besides his head, as that usually means instant death\\), he also suffers Blood Loss\\. If he survives the experience, he \\(or another character\\) must treat the stump\\. This does not require a test, but the character performing it must have training in the Medicae skill\\. If he succeeds, it heals properly and he is no longer in direct danger\\. If he does not receive treatment, however, roll 1d10; on a result of 8 or lower, he dies a horrible death from infection over the next 1d10 days\\. After losing a limb, a character does not remove damage through natural healing for 1d10\\+2 days\\. \n\nLost Hand \n\nThe character suffers a –20 penalty on all skill and characteristic tests that rely on the use of two hands, and he cannot wield twohanded weapons\\. He can, however, strap a shield to the injured arm to offer some use in combat\\. \n\n#### Lost Arm\n\nAs with a lost hand, but a character cannot strap a shield to the arm since he no longer has it\\. Unless he acquires a bionic replacement, his ability to serve the Emperor is greatly reduced\\. \n\n#### Lost Eye\n\nLosing one eye permanently reduces a character's Ballistic Skill by 10\\. In addition, he suffers a –20 penalty to all skill and characteristics tests that rely on sight\\. Should a character have the misfortune to lose both eyes, he becomes Blinded\\.\n\n#### Lost Foot \n\nThe character permanently reduces all his Movement by half \\(rounded up\\) and suffers a –20 penalty on all tests for Movement actions, as well as skill and characteristic tests that could rely on mobility, such as Stealth\\. \n\n#### Lost Leg \n\nTreat this as a lost foot, but the character cannot use the Dodge skill\\. Losing both legs means the character cannot walk unless he has suitable cybernetic replacements installed\\.\n\n### Blinded \n\nA Blinded character automatically fails all tests based on vision, and automatically fails all Ballistic Skill tests\\. He also suffers a –30 penalty to Weapon Skill tests and most other tests that ordinarily benefit from vision\\. Luckily, bionic eyes are a relatively commonplace cybernetic replacement in the Imperium\\. \n\n### Blood Loss \n\nBlood Loss is a condition that can result from Critical damage\\. At the start of his turn, an affected character suffers 1 level of Fatigue\\. Once per round as a Free Action, he \\(or another character who can reach him\\) can attempt a Difficult \\(–10\\) Medicae test to remove this condition\\. The GM should modify the test as needed if the character is performing a strenuous activity or under attack, or if the subject is not in active combat or using more actions\\. Note that multiple Blood Loss conditions do not stack\\. \n\n### Deafened \n\nThe character cannot hear at all, or at least not well enough to communicate with others\\. Until he recovers or has the damage repaired, he automatically fails any skill or characteristic test that relies on hearing\\. Apart from having trouble communicating with his fellow Players, the GM is free to decide what effects the character's deafness has on the game\\. \n\n### Falling \n\nPlayers can fall off things for all manner of reasons, though the results are usually the same\\. When a character falls a dangerous distance \\(as determined by the GM\\), he suffers falling damage\\. The falling character suffers 1d10 Impact damage, plus 1 additional damage per metre he fell, to a randomly determined Hit Location\\. Damage from a fall ignores Armour \\(but not Toughness\\)\\. The GM can adjust the damage depending on the type of surface landed upon, abnormal gravity conditions, and other factors\\. \n\n### Fire \n\nA character can be set on fire in several different ways \\(none of them pleasant\\)\\. First, weapons with the Flame quality and certain Energy Critical Effects can set a character on fire\\. Alternatively, a character can be ignited by fire in the environment; for this second case, at the beginning of each round after the first in which the character is exposed to the same source of flames, he must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Agility test or catch on fire\\. Once a character is on fire, he suffers 1d10 Energy damage \\(ignoring Armour\\) and suffers 1 level of Fatigue each round until the fire is extinguished\\. If the location is not otherwise specified, this applies to the Body location\\. While on fire, he must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Willpower test at the beginning of each of his turns in order to be able to take actions normally; otherwise, he may only flail in agony and scream, which counts as a Full Action\\. A character who is on fire can try to extinguish the flames by dropping Prone and making a Hard \\(–20\\) Agility test as a Full Action\\. The GM can make this test easier or harder depending on environmental conditions and whether the blazing character is able to receive any help from nearby allies\\. \n\n### Stunned \n\nIn addition to damage and Fatigue, characters can also become Stunned due to certain attacks or effects\\. Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill tests to hit Stunned characters gain a \\+20 bonus\\. Stunned characters cannot take actions or Reactions such as Evasion, but are not considered a Helpless or Unaware targets\\. \n\n### Suffocation \n\nThere are many ways to suffocate, including drowning, smoke inhalation, and exposure to certain toxins\\. The rate of suffocation depends on the character's activity level\\. If a character is actively trying to conserve oxygen, he can hold his breath for a number of minutes equal to his Toughness bonus\\. If a character is instead engaged in strenuous activity \\(combat, swimming, and so forth\\) he can hold his breath for a number of rounds equal to twice his Toughness bonus\\. While holding his breath, a character must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Toughness test each minute \\(if conserving oxygen\\) or each round \\(if engaged in strenuous activity\\)\\. If he fails, he suffers one level of Fatigue\\. If the character has not gained a fresh source of oxygen by the end of the allotted time, he automatically falls Unconscious regardless of his levels of Fatigue\\. If a character is both Unconscious and deprived of a fresh source of oxygen, he dies after a number of rounds equal to his Toughness bonus\\. \n\n### Unconsciousness \n\nUnconsciousness is usually a temporary state that typically results from excessive levels of Fatigue or Critical damage\\. The duration of a state of Unconsciousness is usually included in the description of the effect that caused it, but if no other duration is given, Unconsciousness lasts for 10 minutes\\. An Unconscious character is completely unaware of his surroundings and cannot take any actions\\. He is also treated as a Helpless target\\. If a character falls into Unconsciousness due to excessive levels of Fatigue, he recovers some of that Fatigue when he awakens\\.\n\n### Useless Limbs \n\nThough the human form has many vulnerabilities, human limbs can often be snapped, shattered, and shredded before they are lost completely\\. Limbs can be rendered Useless by certain Critical Effects\\. While a limb is Useless, its owner suffers all of the penalties associated with having lost that limb \\(see the Lost Hand, Lost Arm, Lost Eye, Lost Foot, and Lost Leg conditions\\)\\. The limb is not actually severed, however, so its owner does not suffer Blood Loss and the other effects that accompany an Amputated Limb\\.\n\n### Vacuum \n\nThere is nothing pleasant about being exposed to vacuum\\. There are two main ways this unfortunate event could occur: \n\n- A character can be suddenly thrust into an airless, unpressurised environment \\(such as being unexpectedly expelled from an airlock into space\\)\\. \n- A character can be slowly affected \\(such as being on a damaged voidship as atmosphere is vented into space\\)\\. \n\nA character exposed to vacuum can survive unharmed for a number of rounds equal to his Toughness bonus\\. At the end of each round after this, he suffers 1d10 Explosive damage \\(ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus\\)\\. Since vacuums are airless by definition, a character in a vacuum also begins suffering the effects of Suffocation unless he has an oxygen source\\. If a character is in the vacuum of space, at the end of each round he must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Toughness test or suffer 1d10 Energy damage from the extreme cold \\(ignoring Armour and Toughness bonus\\)\\. If a character dies in space, it takes five rounds for his corpse to freeze\\. If a frozen corpse suffers any damage, it shatters into thousands of blood\\-red ice shards\\. If a character is trapped in a gradually worsening atmosphere, he can survive unharmed for a number of rounds equal to twice his Toughness bonus\\. At the end of this time, he begins to experience Suffocation and depressurisation \\(as detailed above\\)\\. However, the damage for the decompression is only 1d5 instead of 1d10\\.\n\n## Healing \n\nA character inevitably suffers damage during his battles in the name of the Emperor\\. As a character accumulates damage, he progresses through three different states: Lightly Damaged, Heavily Damaged, and Critically Damaged\\. \n\n### Lightly Damaged \n\nA character is considered Lightly Damaged if he has taken damage equal to or less than twice his Toughness bonus\\. A Lightly Damaged character removes 1 point of damage per day through natural healing\\. If a Lightly Damaged character devotes an entire day to bed rest, he removes an amount of damage equal to his Toughness bonus\\. Once he removes all damage, a character ceases to be Lightly Damaged\\. \n\n### Heavily Damaged \n\nA character is Heavily Damaged whenever he has taken more damage than twice his Toughness bonus\\. A Heavily Damaged character does not remove damage unless he devotes himself to complete rest \\(such as when receiving extended care, as per the Medicae skill\\)\\. If he does so, the character removes 1 point of damage at the end of each 24–hour period\\. Once a Heavily Damaged character's damage is equal to or less than twice his Toughness bonus, he becomes Lightly Damaged instead\\. \n\n### Critically Damaged \n\nA character is Critically Damaged whenever he has taken damage in excess of his wounds\\. A Critically Damaged character does not remove damage unless he devotes himself to complete rest \\(such as when receiving extended care, as per the Medicae skill\\)\\. If he does so, the character makes a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Toughness test at the end of each 24–hour period\\. If he succeeds, he removes 1 point of Critical damage\\. Once all Critical damage has been removed, a character becomes Heavily Damaged instead\\. \n\n### Medical Attention \n\nMedical attention can range from the application of healing drugs to a successful Medicae test\\. Medical attention can provide immediate recovery or can speed the process of natural healing\\. For additional information, see the Medicae skills\\. Medical attention can also be something granted between game sessions by the GM, and would not necessarily be tied to Medicae tests or other skills that any character might have\\. This is up to the GM to establish, and would usually involve the passage of time via narrative time, although this should be done to help speed the game along\\. A GM should avoid leaving players in situations where they have a Heavily or Critically Damaged character and due to this are unable to participate in the game\\. \n\n### Cybernetic and Bionic Replacements \n\nIt is possible—and often a good idea—to restore lost limbs with bionic replacements\\. In fact, sometimes an Acolyte might prefer to lop off a perfectly good arm to gain the benefits of having a cybernetic replacement to better honour the Omnissiah\\. See Armoury for how cybernetic and bionic replacements work as well as the process for obtaining them\\.\n","excerpt":"# Injury   The life of a Player in the 41st millennium is filled with physical stress\\. Devastating weapons effects, horrid creature attacks, baleful mental tortures, and more can reduce a character to a bleeding lump of flesh in desperate need of medicae assistance\\. Other actions, such as sprinting across a minefield, can also lessen a character's effectiveness\\. Common physical injuries to Players are represented by damage and Fatigue\\. Additionally, characters can also experience several types of conditions and special damage such as fire, suffocation, and limb loss\\. It is important to know how much physical abuse a character can take, and a key measurement of this is how many wounds he possesses\\. "},{"srdPath":"combat/structured_time","title":"Structured Time","content":"# Structured Time\n\nCombat takes place in structured time, as opposed to narrative time, which covers situations where time and the precise order of actions is less of a factor\\. Narrative time presents an abstracted version approach to situations, suitable when time can flow for days or even weeks such as travel across worlds or between stars\\. This aspect of the game is covered in Narrative Tools, while game play during the heat of conflict or whenever a moment's decision can decide life or death is presented here\\.\n\n## Combat Encounters \n\nIn combat or during other time\\-sensitive tasks, every second counts, and the order in which things happen is crucial\\. To help maintain order in the chaos of battle and other events where time is of the essence, a combat encounter is broken down into rounds, turns, and actions\\.\n\n### Rounds \n\nA round consists of each character in the encounter taking one turn\\. Although the characters take their turns in an order in the game system, it is assumed that they are all acting more or less simultaneously in the game world\\. Each round represents roughly five seconds, regardless of how many characters are involved\\. \n\n### Turns \n\nEach character in an encounter gets one turn each round, during which he can perform one or more actions\\. While characters' turns actually overlap each other slightly, turns are resolved in a specific order known as Initiative order\\. \n\n### Actions \n\nA character can perform one or more actions during his turn\\. Actions represent tasks the character might want to undertake, from moving down a corridor or into cover, to firing his gun at the enemy\\. When performing multiple actions, the character can execute them in any order he chooses\\.\n\n## Combat Overview \n\nCombat is usually resolved using structured time divided into rounds, turn, and actions\\. Each character \\(including NPCs\\), takes one turn each round\\. Although the action during combat is happening nearly simultaneously in the game world, the different turns during a round are taken in a specific order to keep things organized\\. The order of these turns is determined by Initiative at the beginning of a combat encounter\\. \n\nWhen a new combat begins, follow these steps to determine what happens: \n\n### Step 1: Surprise \n\nAt the beginning of a combat, the GM determines whether any characters are Surprised\\. This can only happen once, at the beginning of a combat, and there will be many combats wherein nobody is Surprised\\. During the first round of combat, a Surprised character loses his turn and cannot use Reactions because he has been caught unawares by his enemies\\. If no one is Surprised, move immediately to the next step\\. \n\n### Step 2: Set the Scene \n\nBefore the characters can begin taking their turns, the players need to be aware of everything going on in the scene\\. The Game Master outlines the scenario \\(or at least the parts that the characters can observe\\): the combatants they face, the relative positions of everyone involved in the combat, and their surrounding environment\\. \n\n### Step 3: Determine Initiative \n\nTo determine the order in which the characters take their turns during each round, each character involved in the combat makes an Initiative roll\\. The GM rolls for all Non\\-Player Characters\\. \n\n### Step 4: Combatants Take Turns \n\nStarting with the character at the top of the Initiative order, each character takes a turn\\. The character currently taking his turn is known as the active character, and can perform one or more actions\\. Once his actions have been resolved, his turn ends and any lingering effects that specify a duration of “until the end of the player's turn” now end\\. The next character in the Initiative order then becomes the active character and takes his turn, and so forth\\. \n\n### Step 5: Round Ends \n\nOnce each character has taken a turn, the round is over\\. Any lingering effects that specify a duration of “until the end of the round” now end\\. \n\n### Step 6: Encounter Ends \n\nContinue to repeat Steps 4 and 5 until the combat is finished, or until the non\\-combat event \\(the discovery of an explosive ready to detonate, for example\\) that triggered the switch into structured time is resolved\\.\n\n## Initiative\n\nInitiative is rolled once at the beginning of each combat encounter, and determines the order in which all characters take turns each round during that encounter\\. To determine the Initiative order, each character rolls 1d10 and adds his Agility bonus to the result\\. The GM rolls Initiative for all NPCs involved in the encounter\\. To keep things simple, it is recommended that the GM make one Initiative roll for each group of similar enemy characters\\. \n\nAfter each character has determined his Initiative, the GM makes a list, placing them in order from highest to lowest\\. This list is known as the Initiative order, which is the order in which characters take turns each round, until the end of the combat\\. \n\nIf more than one character has the same Initiative score, the one with the higher Agility characteristic is placed higher in the Initiative order\\. If they also have the same Agility characteristic, they both roll 1d10, and the character with the higher roll is placed higher in the Initiative order\\. \n\nOnce the Initiative order has been established, it usually remains the same from round to round\\. If new combatants join in the middle of the fight, simply determine their Initiatives normally and insert them into the Initiative order\\. The GM can choose to re\\-establish the Initiative order during an encounter if the events of the story demand it, and this can involve additional Surprised rounds\\. Generally speaking though, events such as this should be rare, and should be used to heighten tension and introduce unique or interesting new elements to the combat, rather than just when more enemy forces show up\n\n## Surprise \n\nWhen a combat begins, some of the characters involved might be unaware of their opponents' presence or hostile intentions\\. Usually, a character is allowed an Awareness skill test to attempt to avoid this\\. There are some situations, however, where almost any character would be hard\\-pressed to see the threat coming\\. Examples of this include: \n\n- Heavy rainstorms, nearby artillery barrages, void\\-ship launchings, and other sustained durations of loud noises\\. \n- Carefully constructed ambushes \\(gained from successful Stealth tests to sneak up on the Players, or Concealment skills that were used to hide attackers from easy view\\)\\.\n- Settings that cause the Players to let their guard down, such as a governor's reception or Ministorum service\\. \n- A sudden appearance of torch\\-wielding fanatics, mass hysteria in a crowded hab tavern, or other distracting events\\. \n\nIf there is at least one Surprised combatant, the first round of combat is referred to as a Surprised round\\. During a Surprised round, all combatants roll for Initiative as normal, but any Surprised combatants lose their turn during the Surprised round\\. All the non\\-Surprised combatants take actions using the standard Initiative order\\. The Surprised combatant \\(or group of combatants\\) can do nothing except remain in whatever state they were when combat started \\(which in most cases means they simply stand still\\) either because they are in shock or because they are simply unaware that they are under attack\\. Surprised combatants cannot use Reactions during a Surprised round\\. Furthermore, a non\\-Surprised attacker receives a \\+30 bonus to Weapon Skill and Ballistic Skill tests made to attack a Surprised target\\. After the Surprised round completely resolves, all Surprised characters recover their wits and can act normally, joining the Initiative order at whatever place they rolled at the start of the Surprised round\\.\n","excerpt":"# Structured Time  Combat takes place in structured time, as opposed to narrative time, which covers situations where time and the precise order of actions is less of a factor\\. Narrative time presents an abstracted version approach to situations, suitable when time can flow for days or even weeks such as travel across worlds or between stars\\. This aspect of the game is covered in Narrative Tools, while game play during the heat of conflict or whenever a moment's decision can decide life or death is presented here\\."},{"srdPath":"combat/the_attack","title":"The Attack","content":"# The Attack \n\nThe most common action in combat is the attack—the characters are fighting, after all\\. Whether armed with a melee or ranged weapon, the process is the same\\. Before an attack is made, the GM should verify that the attack is even possible by checking the basic requirements for the attack\\. Melee attacks require the attacker to be engaged in melee combat with his target\\. Ranged attacks cannot be made if the attacker is engaged in melee, unless he is firing a Pistol\\-class weapon\\. In either case, the attacker must be aware of his target; see the Spray and Pray for additional information\\. Assuming the attack is possible, follow these steps: \n\n- __Step One:__ Apply Modifiers to Attacker's Characteristic \n- __Step Two:__ Attacker Makes a Test \n- __Step Three:__ Attacker Determines Hit Location \n- __Step Four:__ Attacker Determines Damage \n- __Step Five:__ Target Applies Damage\n\n## Step One: Apply Modifiers to Attacker's Characteristic \n\nA melee attack requires the attacker to make a Weapon Skill test\\. A ranged attack requires the attacker to make a Ballistic Skill test\\. There are many instances where one or more factors make performing an attack easier or more difficult than normal\\. For example, using the Full Auto Burst attack action imposes a –10 penalty on the attacker's Ballistic Skill test, whereas a Standard Attack grants a \\+10 bonus whether the attack is melee or ranged\\. The GM can also impose additional penalties or bonuses to the test if the situation warrants it\\. If a situation calls for two or more bonuses or penalties, simply combine all modifiers together and apply the total to the appropriate characteristic\\. The maximum total bonus that can be applied to a test is \\+60\\. Conversely, the maximum total penalty that can be applied to a test is –60\\. When adjudicating difficulty, common sense should prevail\\. Regardless of the usual limits on test penalties, some actions are simply impossible, and no test is permissible\\.\n\n## Step Two: Attacker Makes a Test \n\nAfter the modified characteristic has been determined, the attacker makes a Weapon Skill test if he is performing a melee attack, or a Ballistic Skill test if performing a ranged attack\\. Either of these is resolved like any other test\\. If the roll is equal to or less than the modified characteristic, the attack hits\\.\n\n### Evasion Reactions \n\nWhen a target is hit by an attack, it can have a chance to negate the hit with an Evasion reaction\\. If it succeeds at its Evasion reaction and manages to negate all hits, the attack fails and no damage is dealt\\.\n\n### Stray Shots \n\nGMs keen on reinforcing the merciless nature of the 41st Millennium can rule that if a character shooting into a melee combat misses his target by a small margin \\(one degree of failure\\), the attack instead hits another target engaged in the same melee\\. The GM might also rule that anyone shooting into a melee combat with a Semi\\-Auto Burst or Full Auto Burst must allocate multiple hits to different targets engaged in the melee\\.\n\n### Spray and Pray \n\nSituations might arise where a character is aware of a danger stalking him, but is unable to see it\\. In these cases, a character can use his attack for the turn to wildly fire or strike out in hopes of hitting his hidden antagonist\\. In these cases, it is up to the Game Master to determine a number between 1 and 100 that represents the character's percentage chance of hitting his target, or if the character is even firing in the correct direction at all\\. Then, during Step Two of the attack, the Game Master rolls 1d100 and compares the result to the percentage chance\\. If he rolls equal to or under the number, the attack proceeds as normal\\. If he rolls over the number, the attack misses the hidden opponent, and has no effect other than perhaps drawing even more unwanted attention to the unfortunate character and his actions\\.\n\n### Weapon Jams \n\nWeapons can jam through extreme age, maltreatment of their machine spirit, or just plain poor design\\. An unmodified result of 96–100 on a Ranged attack indicates the weapon has jammed\\. This means the attack automatically misses, and the weapon cannot be fired until the jam is cleared\\. Clearing a jam is a Full Action that requires a Ballistic Skill test\\. If the character attempting to clear the jam succeeds on the test, then the jam has been cleared, though the weapon needs to be reloaded and any ammo in it is lost\\. If he fails on the test, the weapon is still jammed, though he can attempt to clear it again next round\\. Some weapons, such as plasma guns, grenades, and missiles, carry extra risks associated with jamming\\. For these weapons, refer to their descriptions and weapon special qualities\\. Semi\\-automatic and fully automatic fire also increases the likelihood of jamming; this is described within the Semi\\-Auto Burst, Full Auto Burst, and Suppressing Fire actions\\.\n\n## Step Three: Attacker Determines Hit Location \n\nOn a successful hit, the attacker needs to determine where the hit landed\\. Using the percentile dice result from the attacker's Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill test \\(or the Focus Power test, in the case of psychic attacks\\), reverse the order of the digits \\(e\\.g\\., a roll of 32 becomes 23, a roll of 20 becomes 02, and so on\\) and compare this number to Hit Locations \n\n### Hit Locations\n__Roll__ | __Location__\n--------|---------\n01 – 10 |Head\n11 – 20 |Right Arm\n21 – 30 |Left Arm\n31 – 70 |Body\n71 – 85 |Right Leg\n86 – 100|Left Leg\n\n### Multiple Hits                  \n__First Hit__ | __Second Hit__ | __Third Hit__ | __Fourth Hit__ | __Fifth Hit__ | __Each Additional Hit__\n--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---\nHead | Head | Arm | Body | Arm | Body \nArm | Arm | Body | Head | Body | Arm \nBody | Body | Arm | Head | Arm | Body \nLeg | Leg | Body | Arm | Head | Body \n\n## Step Four: Attacker Determines Damage \n\nAfter the Hit Location has been determined, the attacker determines the damage dealt by each hit the attack inflicted\\. Each weapon has a damage listing, which is usually a die roll, plus or minus a number\\. Roll the appropriate die and apply any indicated modifiers for each hit\\. Finally, if the attack involved a melee weapon, add the attacker's Strength bonus\\. The result is the damage total\\. \n\nFor all attack rolls, count the degrees of success\\. *The attacker can replace the result on a single damage die with the number of degrees of success from his attack roll*\\. If the attack inflicts more than one hit or more than one die of damage, the attacker can replace the result on one die of his choice with the degrees of success from the attack roll\\. If a natural 10 is rolled any damage die for a given hit, the hit inflicts Righteous Fury\\.\n\n### Righteous Fury \n\nWhen rolling damage after a successful hit, if any die rolled results in a natural 10 \\(rolling the 10 result on a 10 sided die\\), a particularly bloody and spectacular hit might be inflicted\\. This also includes a result of 10 when rolling 1d5 for damage\\. After resolving the effects of the hit, one of two things can happen\\. \n\nIf the hit dealt damage after being reduced by Armour and Toughness bonus, then the hit becomes more severe\\. The attacker then rolls 1d5 and consults the Critical Effects table appropriate to the damage type and location of the original attack\\. The target suffers all effects listed\\. However, the target does not count as having suffered Critical damage\\. In other words, if he takes damage during later turns, it affects his wounds, not directly stacking onto worsening Critical Effects\\. Talents that modify Critical damage \\(such as Deathdealer and True Grit\\) do not modify the critical effects generated by Righteous Fury, and these effects do not stack if a target suffers Righteous Fury multiple times\\. Each roll is applied as a separate effect\\. \n\nAlternatively, if the hit does not deal any damage once reduced by Armour and Toughness bonus, then the hit deals 1 point of damage, not reduced by Armour or Toughness\\. This is the extent of the Righteous Fury effect for this hit; the victim does not suffer a roll on a Critical Effect table\\. This represents some weapons simply not being potent enough to deal major damage, but still able to do harm through a “lucky shot\\.”\n\n### Righteous Fury for Player Characters and NPCs \n\nRighteous Fury is something that both Player Characters and major NPCs can inflict and suffer\\. This means if a cult magos shoots a Player Character and rolls a 10 for damage, then the Player Character suffers a 1d5 Critical Effect result\\. This makes combat gritty, dangerous, and more dynamic, as the characters can suffer from flavourful \\(and often awful\\) Critical damage, and can leave combat with interesting new scars\\. However, in order to ensure that combat does not bog down too much, when a low\\-level NPC \\(a faceless soldier or minion, usually an unnamed NPC not central to the story plot\\) suffers Righteous Fury, he is simply slain instead\\. These Troop level NPCs also usually cannot benefit from this rule when inflicting damage on the Player\\.\n\nThese rules make for faster game play, but if all players agree, then all types of NPCs including low\\-level Troops can use the Righteous Fury rules\\. This might slow down gameplay, but it also allows for the PCs to truly prove their skills in combat\\. After all, the Emperor knows your worth by your scars, and when playing in this manner, the Players are certain to gain quite a few\\.\n\n### Zealous Hatred\n\nSome sources reference Zealous Hatred instead of Righteous Fury\\. These terms are interchangeable, use whichever fits thematically\n\n## Step Five: Target Applies Damage \n\nFrom the damage total, the target subtracts his Toughness bonus and any Armour points that protect the location that the attack struck\\. If this reduces the damage to zero or less, the target shrugs off the hit\\. The target records any remaining damage, adding it to any previously suffered, and then compares this total to his total amount of wounds\\. If the target's damage equals or exceeds his wounds, he notes any excess damage as Critical damage, and the GM consults the appropriate table based on the type of damage, the location hit, and the amount of Critical damage accumulated\\. See Critical Damage\\.\n\n# Unarmed Combat \n\nNot every fight requires lasguns and chainswords\\. Some conflicts can be settled the old\\-fashioned way, with fists or even teeth\\. Unarmed attacks are treated just like those from any other melee weapon, and successful hits inflict 1d5–3\\+SB Impact damage with no penetration\\. If this inflicts damage equal to or greater than the target's Toughness bonus, it also inflicts one level of Fatigue\\. Whenever an unarmed character attempts to strike an armed foe \\(one currently wielding a Melee or Pistol weapon\\), or Parry an armed foe's attacks, he suffers a –20 penalty on his Weapon Skill tests\\.\n\n### Grappling \n\nInstead of inflicting damage with an unarmed attack, a character can attempt to Grapple his opponent\\. Attempting a Grapple is a melee attack that uses either a Charge action or a Standard Attack action\\. The attacker makes a Weapon Skill test as normal\\. The target of the Grapple may use a Reaction, if able, to avoid the attack\\. If the attack is successful, the attacker and the target start to Grapple, with the attacker controlling the Grapple\\. In a Grapple, all of the following apply: \n\n- Participants in a Grapple cannot use Reactions\\. \n- Participants in a Grapple are considered to be engaged in melee combat\\. \n- Participants in a Grapple can only use the Grapple action\\. \n- The controller of the Grapple can voluntarily end the Grapple at any point during his turn as a Free Action\\. \n- Other attackers gain a \\+20 bonus to Weapon Skill tests to hit any target engaged in a Grapple\\. \n- Only two characters can be engaged in the same Grapple, but up to two other characters can lend Assistance to each Grappler in certain situations\\.\n\n#### Grapple Action\n\nThis action is only used when a character is already engaged in a Grapple\\. If the active character is controlling the Grapple, the first thing he must do on his turn is declare Grapple as a Full Action in order to maintain the Grapple; if he does not declare Grapple as his Full Action, the Grapple immediately ends\\. After that, he can choose one of the following Controller Grapple Options: \n\n- __Damage Opponent:__ The controller of the Grapple can attempt to damage his opponent with brute force by making an Opposed Strength test with the Grappled opponent\\. If the active character wins, he inflicts unarmed damage \\(1d5–3\\+SB\\) to his opponent's Body location and one level of Fatigue\\. If the grappled opponent wins the Opposed Strength test, no damage is dealt, but he remains Grappled\\. This test can benefit from Assistance\\. \n- __Throw Down Opponent:__ The controller of the Grapple can attempt to wrestle his Grappled opponent to the ground by making an Opposed Strength test\\. This test can benefit from Assistance\\. If the active character wins, the Grappled opponent becomes Prone\\. The controller can choose to end the Grapple at this point as a Free Action, or may continue to Grapple the Prone opponent, gaining a \\+10 to all further Opposed tests made during this Grapple until the Prone opponent manages to stand \\(assuming he is able to\\)\\. This bonus is in addition to the standard \\+10 gained when attacking Prone opponents\\. \n- __Push Opponent:__ The controller can attempt to force his Grappled opponent to move\\. This is resolved with an Opposed Strength test, which can benefit from Assistance\\. If the active character succeeds, he pushes his opponent one metre in a direction of his choice, plus one additional metre for each degree of success\\. This pushed distance cannot exceed the active character's Half Move distance\\. The active character must move with his Grappled opponent in order to maintain the Grapple, or he can choose to let go of his opponent as a Free Action, which ends the Grapple, but allows the active character to keep his ground\\.\n- __Ready:__ The controller of the Grapple can ready one of his own items\\. Or if the GM allows, he can use the Ready action to grab an item belonging to his Grappled opponent\\. \n- __Stand:__ If both participants are on the ground, the controller of the Grapple can regain his feet with this action\\. He can also attempt to drag his opponent up with him by making an Opposed Strength test\\. This test can benefit from Assistance\\. If the controller of the Grapple wins, both participants stand\\. \n- __Use Item:__ The controller can use a readied item if desired\\.\n\n#### Grappled Target Options: \nIf the active character is the target of the Grapple, the first thing he must do on his turn is declare Grapple as a Half Action—this is part of the penalty for being Grappled\\. After that, he can choose one of the following \n- __Break Free:__ The Grappled target can attempt to break free of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength test against the controller of the Grapple\\. This test can benefit from Assistance\\. If the active character wins, he breaks free and may perform any Half Action\\. \n- __Slip Free:__ The Grappled target can attempt to wriggle out of the Grapple by making a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Acrobatics test\\. If he succeeds, he slips free and may perform any Half Action\\. \n- __Take Control:__ The Grappled target can attempt to take control of the Grapple by making an Opposed Strength test against his Grappling opponent\\. This test can benefit from Assistance\\. If the active character wins, he becomes the controller of the Grapple and his opponent becomes the Grappled target\\. The active character may then immediately perform one of the Controller Grapple Options, but he cannot take any other Half Actions\\. \n\n#### Grappling Size Differences\n\nIf one character is larger than the other, the larger scores one extra degree of success on successful Opposed tests performed as part of the Grapple for every point by which the value of his Size trait exceeds his opponent's Size trait\\.\n\n# Two\\-Weapon Fighting \n\nMany warriors fight with a weapon in either hand, and there are advantages and disadvantages to this style of fighting\\. While it offers some improved opportunities to make attacks, it also reduces the chances of successfully striking a target\\. The character can use any melee weapons or ranged weapons that can be reasonably used in one hand\\. These are generally Pistol class ranged weapons \\(though some Basic class weapons can have modifications that allow them to be used with one hand, or simply used with a penalty\\), and melee weapons that note they are one\\-handed weapons in their descriptions\\. \n\n- The character can use either hand to make an attack\\. \n- If the character has the Two\\-Weapon Wielder talent, he can attack with both weapons, but each attack suffers a –20 penalty to the Weapon Skill or Ballistic Skill test\\. \n- If the character has the Ambidextrous talent, the penalty to the attack is lessened\\. His penalty for fighting with two weapons drops to –10, but note that other talents or situational modifiers can possibly further affect these modifiers\\. \n- If the character is wielding at least one melee weapon, he may use the Parry skill to perform an Evasion reaction once each round as normal with this weapon, though he still cannot Evade more than once in a round\\. \n- If a character with the Two\\-Weapon Wielder \\(Melee\\) talent is armed with two melee weapons, he can perform a melee Attack action \\(either a Standard Attack, Swift Attack, or Lightning Attack\\) with one of these weapons\\. He can then perform a melee Attack action \\(either a Standard Attack, Swift Attack, or Lightning Attack\\) with the other weapon, with any applicable modifiers to the test\\. These attacks can be made against any target in melee\\. \n- If a character with the Two\\-Weapon Wielder \\(Ballistic\\) talent is armed with two Pistols \\(or other ranged weapons that can reasonably be wielded in one hand\\), he can perform a ranged Attack action \\(either a Standard Attack, Semi\\-Auto Burst, or Full\\-Auto Burst\\) with one of these weapons\\. If he does so, he can then perform another ranged Attack action \\(either a Standard Attack, Semi\\-Auto Burst, or Full Auto Burst\\) with his second weapon\\. \n- When firing a ranged weapon with each hand, the character may fire each weapon on a different mode, for example, one on full automatic and one on semi\\-automatic\\. When firing a full automatic weapon in each hand, the character can only lay down one area of suppressive fire\\. \n- If a character with the Two\\-Weapon Wielder \\(Melee\\) and Two Weapon Wielder \\(Ballistic\\) talent is armed with a Melee weapon in one hand and a one\\-handed ranged weapon in the other, he may perform a melee attack action \\(either a Standard Attack, Swift Attack, or Lightning Attack\\) or ranged attack action \\(such as Standard Attack, Semi\\-Auto Burst, or Full Auto Burst\\) with one weapon\\. He may then make a second melee attack action or ranged attack action with his secondary weapon\\. Any ranged weapon hits must be inflicted upon targets in melee\\. Resolve each attack separately by testing Weapon Skill for the melee weapon and Ballistic Skill for the ranged weapon\\. \n- The character can fire two weapons at different targets, though the targets must be within 10 metres of each other\\.\n","excerpt":"# The Attack   The most common action in combat is the attack—the characters are fighting, after all\\. Whether armed with a melee or ranged weapon, the process is the same\\. Before an attack is made, the GM should verify that the attack is even possible by checking the basic requirements for the attack\\. Melee attacks require the attacker to be engaged in melee combat with his target\\. Ranged attacks cannot be made if the attacker is engaged in melee, unless he is firing a Pistol\\-class weapon\\. In either case, the attacker must be aware of his target; see the Spray and Pray for additional information\\. Assuming the attack is possible, follow these steps: "},{"srdPath":"combat/the_turn","title":"The Turn","content":"# The Turn \n\nWhen the Initiative order reaches a character, it is time for him to take his turn and perform actions and other activities\\. Each turn is broken into three distinct parts: the start of the turn, performing actions, and the end of the turn\\. A Player spends most of his turn performing actions, and these actions usually have the greatest impact on combats and adventures\\. \n\n## Actions \n\nDuring each normal round, every character gets a turn to act\\. On his turn, a character can take one or more actions\\. Actions represent everything a character does over the course of a combat: running down a dark corridor, firing a lasgun at an enemy, fixing a piece of arcane technology before it explodes, or even channeling the dangerous powers of the Warp\\. There are five types of actions, and every action also has one or more subtypes\\. \n\n### Full Actions \n\nA Full Action requires a character's complete attention to accomplish\\. A character can take one Full Action on his turn and cannot take any Half Actions\\. Running towards an opponent is an example of a Full Action\\. \n\n### Half Actions \n\nA Half Action is fairly simple; it requires some effort or concentration, but not so much that it consumes a character's entire turn\\. A character can take two different Half Actions on his turn instead of taking one Full Action\\. Readying a weapon or making a Standard Attack are both examples of Half Actions\\. \n\n### Reactions \n\nA Reaction is a special action made in response to some event, such as an attack\\. A character receives one Reaction each round, which he can only use when it is not his turn\\. Examples include making an Evasion test to avoid an attack\\.\n\n### Free Actions \n\nFree Actions take only a moment to complete and usually require no real effort\\. A character can perform Free Actions in addition to any other actions on his turn\\. Although there is no formal limit on the number of Free Actions a character can take during a single turn, the GM should use common sense to set reasonable limits on what can be accomplished in a few seconds\\. Examples of Free Actions include calling out a short warning to a fellow Player, removing a vision\\-restricting hat, or dropping an unneeded item\\. \n\n### Extended Actions \n\nSome actions require longer than a single round to complete\\. These could include repairing a damaged cogitator, reloading a bulky weapon, or translating a dead race's language\\. Extended Actions are initiated on the character's turn, and are the only type of action that can be undertaken across multiple rounds\\. Once a character commits to completing an Extended Action, he is considered to be working towards completing it as long as necessary\\. If the character abandons the Extended Action, or is interrupted, all progress towards completing the action is lost\\. \n\n### Action Subtypes \n\nIn addition to its type, every action is also categorized into one or more subtypes\\. Action subtypes do not do anything in and of themselves, but they are used to clarify what a character is and is not allowed to do in a variety of special circumstances\\. For example, a character who is Immobilized cannot perform any actions with the Movement subtype\\.\n\n## Using Actions \n\nDuring his turn, a character may perform one Full Action or two different Half Actions\\. A character could, for example, make a Charge action \\(Full Action\\) or make an Aim action and a Standard Attack action, such as shooting \\(two Half Actions\\)\\. It is important to remember that a round is only a few seconds long, so the character's turn within that round is but a few moments\\. \n\nAny action can be combined with talking, banter, battle cries, and other short verbal expressions—these are considered Free Actions—but it is left to the GM to decide what a player might be able to say in that amount of time\\. A wry aside to a companion or a terse insult of an enemy is always reasonable, but recounting the intimate details of one's legendary seven duels to the death between swings of a power sword should probably count as something more than just a Free Action\\. \n\nMost actions are started and completed within the active character's same turn\\. For example, a character does not begin a Charge on one turn and finish it on a later turn in a later round; he performs the entire Charge \\(which is a Full Action\\) at once during his turn\\. However, there are two broad exceptions: Reactions can only be performed when it is not the reacting character's turn, and Extended Actions always take more than one round to complete\\. \n\nCharacters can only take one action with the Attack subtype and one action with the Concentration subtype during their turn\\. They can still take Reactions with the Concentration or Attack subtype during the same round, since this does not happen during their turn\\. Note that sustaining psychic powers \\(most of which have the Concentration subtype\\) does not count as taking actions\\.\n\n## Fleeing \n\nSometimes the best course of action in combat is to get away from danger by any means necessary\\. A character can voluntarily flee from an opponent or be forced to flee because of Fear, a psychic power, or some other effect\\. When a character flees under his own control, he can take any action with the Movement subtype\\. When a character flees against his will, he must Run\\. \n\n### Leaving Melee \n\nIf a character is engaged in melee with one or more opponents and undertakes an action with a Movement subtype to leave combat with them \\(such as fleeing or moving to another target\\) other than the Disengage Action, each of his opponents may immediately make a Standard Attack action against him as a Free Action\\.\n","excerpt":"# The Turn   When the Initiative order reaches a character, it is time for him to take his turn and perform actions and other activities\\.

"},{"srdPath":"core/characteristics","title":"Characteristics","content":"# Characteristics \r\n\r\nCharacteristics represent a character's raw potential and natural physical and mental gifts, such as his strength, agility, intelligence, and skill with melee and ranged weaponry\\. Characteristic values range from 1 to 100 and the higher the characteristic is, the more raw talent the character has in that particular area\\. There are ten characteristics, and each represents a different mental or physical attribute\\. Each is listed briefly here, with its common abbreviation \\(Willpower, for example, is often abbreviated as “WP” in game text\\)\\. \r\n\r\nCharacteristics are important to a character for a number of reasons, not least of which is that they reflect a character's ability to succeed at particular actions\\. Characteristics are modified by external factors such as skills, and can be improved in a number of temporary and permanent ways\\. Since characteristics set the base target number for all tests, high characteristics are always more favourable than low characteristics\\. For more information on how to generate characteristics and how they relate to character generation, see Character Creation\\. \r\n\r\n### Characteristic Bonuses \r\n\r\nIn addition to its numerical value, each characteristic has a characteristic bonus, a number equal to the “tens” digit of that characteristic\\. For example, a character with a Strength of 42 would have a Strength bonus of 4\\. \r\n\r\nWhen a characteristic bonus is abbreviated in text, it uses the normal abbreviation listed for each characteristic with an additional “B” at the end \\(the Agility bonus, for example, would be abbreviated as “AgB” in text\\)\\. \r\n\r\n### Weapon Skill \\(WS\\) \r\n\r\nWeapon Skill measures a character's competence in all forms of close\\-quarters combat\\. Characters with high Weapon Skill values are excellent warriors, renowned with a chainsword or even their bare hands\\. \r\n\r\n### Ballistic Skill \\(BS\\) \r\n\r\nBallistic Skill measures a character's accuracy with all forms of ranged weapons\\. A high Ballistic Skill indicates a character is an excellent marksman, someone to be rightly feared in a fire\\-fight or shootout\\. \r\n\r\n### Strength \\(S\\) \r\n\r\nStrength measures a character's muscle and physical power\\. A high Strength characteristic value allows a character to lift heavier objects and punch a foe harder\\.\r\n\r\n### Toughness \\(T\\) \r\n\r\nToughness measures a character's health, stamina, and resistance\\. Exceptionally Tough characters can shrug off otherwise damaging weapon hits and better withstand poisonous attacks\\. \r\n\r\n### Agility \\(Ag\\) \r\n\r\nThis measures a character's quickness, reflex, and poise\\. High Agility can allow a character to manipulate delicate machinery with finesse, or keep his footing when crossing treacherous terrain\\. This characteristic also determines a character's movement rate; the higher the Agility bonus, the farther he can move each turn\\. \r\n\r\n### Intelligence \\(Int\\) \r\n\r\nIntelligence measures a character's acumen, reason, and general knowledge\\. A character with a strong Intelligence value can recall huge volumes of data, correlate esoteric clues, or determine if an ancient archaeotech relic is genuine or not\\. \r\n\r\n### Perception \\(Per\\) \r\n\r\nThis measures a character's awareness and the acuteness of his senses\\. A character who has a high Perception value can pick out a stray bolter shell casing left amidst an underhive morass, or tell when someone is being deceitful\\. \r\n\r\n### Willpower \\(WP\\) \r\n\r\nWillpower measures a character's mental strength and resilience\\. High Willpower allows a character to exert control over a crowd of near\\-rioting hab workers or interrogate a captured heretic\\. It is also often used when wielding and resisting psychic powers\\.\r\n\r\n### Fellowship \\(Fel\\) \r\n\r\nFellowship measures a character's persuasiveness, ability to lead, and force of personality\\. Having a strong Fellowship makes for a character who can ingratiate himself into a gathering of suspicious forge menials or make skilled trades with wily vendors\\. \r\n\r\n### Influence/Infamy \\(Inf\\) \r\n\r\nThis measures a character's connections, reputation, and resources\\. High Influence can allow a character to quickly summon the aid of local military forces to his side, or arrange for fast transit to another star system\\. Unlike the other characteristics, Influence changes only as a character performs actions: it would decrease should he fail a mission in a highly visible manner, for example, or increase after he successfully rescues a kidnapped planetary governor\\. In the case heretic or otherwise \"Evil\" characters, this characteristic is called Infamy instead\\. The methods used to obtain it may vary, but it functions identically\r\n","excerpt":"# Characteristics \r \r Characteristics represent a character's raw potential and natural physical and mental gifts, such as his strength, agility, intelligence, and skill with melee and ranged weaponry\\.

These are used for three different types of rolls: the d10 roll, the d5 roll, and the percentile \\(d100\\) roll\\. \r\n\r\n### d10 Roll \r\n\r\nWhen required to make a d10 roll, the player or GM rolls a number of ten\\-sided dice indicated before the “d” and adds them together to create the final result\\. For example, a 3d10 roll would consist of three dice rolled and added together \\(for a total result between 3 and 30\\)\\. If there is no number before the “d,” it is assumed to be a 1\\. \r\n\r\n### d5 Roll\r\n\r\nThis follows the same process as above, but the player or GM divides the result on each ten\\-sided die by two and rounds up, to create a result between 1 and 5 for each die\\. \r\n\r\n### Percentile \\(d100\\) Roll\r\n\r\nWhen required to make a percentile roll, the player or GM generates a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two ten\\-sided dice\\. One \\(designated before the roll\\) is the tens digit; the other is the ones digit\\. Two 0s represents 100\\. These tests are commonly abbreviated as “d100” in the text\\. \r\n\r\nOften the rules can call for a dice roll with a fixed modifier to gain a value, such as 2d10\\+5 or 1d5–1\\. In this case, the result from the dice is added or subtracted to the fixed modifier to gain the final result\\. Note that if the final result is less than zero then it counts as zero \\(unless a rule particularly states otherwise\\)\\. Sometimes, a special rule can allow a player to re\\-roll the dice\\. When this happens, the second result must be used, even if it is worse than the original result\\. \r\n\r\n### Rounding and Multiplying \r\n\r\nIf a fraction is generated when dividing, unless specified otherwise round the result up, even if the fraction is less than one\\-half\\. When two or more multipliers apply to a value, add them together to form a single multiple, with each multiplier beyond the first adding 1 less than its value to the first multiplier\\. Thus a double \\(x2\\) and a double \\(x2\\) applied to the same number results in a triple \\(x3, as 2 \\+ 1 = 3\\)\\.\r\n","excerpt":"# Game Dice \r \r Dice rolls use only ten\\-sided polyhedral dice\\.

There are two different methods of keeping time—narrative time and structured time—and each has its own unique rules regarding movement\\. \n\n## Structured and Narrative Time \n\nDuring structured time, which typically involves combat, a character may take a specific action during a round to move at one of four speeds: Half Move, Full Move, Charge, or Run\\. The number of metres a character moves at these various speeds is dictated by his Agility bonus, and can be further modified through some talents or traits\\. \n\n### Movement Speed in Structured Time\n__AgB__|__Half Move__|__Full Move__|__Charge__|__Run__\n---|---------|---------|------|---\n0  |1/2m      |1m        |2m     |3m  \n1  |1m        |2m        |3m     |6m  \n2  |2m        |4m        |6m     |12m \n3  |3m        |6m        |9m     |18m \n4  |4m        |8m        |12m    |24m \n5  |5m        |10m       |15m    |30m \n6  |6m        |12m       |18m    |36m \n7  |7m        |14m       |21m    |42m \n8  |8m        |16m       |24m    |48m \n9  |9m        |18m       |27m    |54m \n10 |10m       |20m       |30m    |60m \n\nDuring narrative time, when a character is not actively involved in combat or some other all\\-consuming, time\\-sensitive task, knowing how far a character can move in a given amount of time is often still important to the story\\. Narrative time movement describes the standard speeds a character can move at a normal pace under ideal circumstances\\. Environment and terrain, discussed below, can affect these speeds, helping or hindering a character as he travels\\. \n\n### Movement Speed in Narrative Time\n__AgB__|__Per Minute__|__Per Hour__|__Per Day__\n---|----------|--------|-------\n0  |12m       |0.75km  |7km    \n1  |24m       |1.5km   |15km   \n2  |48m       |3km     |30km   \n3  |72m       |4km     |40km   \n4  |96m       |6km     |60km   \n5  |120m      |7km     |70km   \n6  |144m      |9km     |90km   \n7  |168m      |10km    |100km  \n8  |192m      |12km    |120km  \n9  |216m      |13km    |130km  \n10 |240m      |14km    |140km  \n\n### Narrative Movement and Terrain \n\nTerrain conditions affect how quickly a character can cover ground during narrative time\\. Slogging through a field full of waist\\-deep snow is much harder than walking across the broad flagstone paved courtyard\\. When moving through thick foliage, dense crowds, soft sand, deep mud, and other similar difficult terrain, a character's Movement is halved\\. Furthermore, the Game Master determines what, if any, modifiers apply to narrative time due to the environment\\. \n\n### Hurrying in Narrative Time \n\nDuring an Acolyte's investigations, time is often of the essence, for the fate of worlds can hang in the balance\\. When moving in narrative time, a character can hurry to double his narrative time Movement\\. While hurrying, a character suffers a –10 penalty to Perception\\-based tests due to the distraction of his haste\\. A character can hurry for a number of consecutive hours equal to his Toughness bonus before he starts to feel its effects\\. At the end of this period, he must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Toughness test or suffer 1 level of Fatigue\\. Additionally, at the end of each consecutive period of the same length for which he hurries, he must make another Toughness test with a cumulative –10 penalty or suffer 1 level of Fatigue\\. For example, he suffers a –10 penalty to his Toughness test at the end of the second period, a –20 after the third, and so forth\\. \n\n### Running in Narrative Time \n\nWhen moving in narrative time, a character can run up to triple his narrative time movement\\. While running, a character suffers a –20 penalty to Perception\\-based tests\\. At the end of the first hour for which he runs, a character must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Toughness or suffer 1 level of Fatigue\\. At the end of each subsequent hour, he must make another Toughness test with a cumulative –10 penalty or suffer 1 level of Fatigue\\.\n\n## Forced Marching \n\nWhile the standard time for marching is ten hours in a day, nothing is stopping characters from continuing past that time\\. After a ten hour march, a character can safely press on for a number of hours equal to his Toughness bonus\\. At the end of the first hour after the end of that period, the character must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Toughness test or suffer 1 level of Fatigue, and must repeat this test with a cumulative –10 penalty at the end of each consecutive hour of marching thereafter\\. Fatigue gained from forced marching is removed at a rate of one level per two hours of rest\\. \n\n## Movement and Environment \n\nThe rates as listed in above assume a relatively clear and uncluttered setting\\. This is rarely the case, however, as few combats take place on a clear day in empty hive habways or open fields, and there can be any number of obstacles present to hinder a character's movement\\. Refuse strewn corridors, deep snow, thick fog, deep, soft sand, dense underbrush—these are but a few examples of the conditions that can complicate navigation\\. In such conditions, a character's structured time Movement rate is halved \\(rounding up\\)\\. \n\nIn structured time, if a character takes a Run or Charge action in a treacherous environment, he must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Agility test\\. Failure means he falls Prone at a point in his movement determined by the GM and based on the degrees of failure\\. The difficulty of this test can be further modified at the GM's discretion based on any number of factors\\. \n\n### Treacherous Environment Agility Modifiers\n__Condition__    |__Modifier__\n-------------|--------\nFog or Smoke |+10     \nMud          |+0      \nShallow Water|+0      \nDarkness     |–10     \nThick Snow   |–10     \nUnderbrush   |–10     \nDense Crowds |–20     \nZero Gravity |–20     \nRubble       |–20     \nTremors      |–20     \n\n## Climbing \n\nThere are many times in a character's experience when the best way to reach a destination or bypass an obstacle is by climbing\\. Clambering over a fence, scaling a city wall, descending into a crevasse, and scaling up a wall to an ideal rooftop sniper position are all instances where climbing is required\\. Climbing is divided into two general categories depending on nature of the terrain: simple climbs and sheer surfaces\\. \n\n### Simple Climbs \n\nSimple climbs include low walls, steep hills, tall piles of rubble, trees, or anything else that requires effort and concentration but no real skill to accomplish\\. Any character with his hands free can automatically accomplish a simple climb as long as he takes his time and is not being distracted \\(while taking fire, for example\\)\\. \n\nIf a character is hurrying, being chased, under fire, or otherwise distracted, he needs to make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Strength or Athletics test to perform a simple climb\\. With one degree of success, the character completes his climb at a rate of one\\-half his Half Move speed\\. For each further degree of success, the character climbs an additional metre\\. If he fails the test, the character falls from his starting climbing position\\. At his discretion, the Game Master can adjust the difficulty of the climb to account for any other factors that he deems appropriate\\. Some types of climb, such as ascending a sturdy ladder or steep flight of stairs, are so simple that no test should be necessary, even when distracted\\. \n\n### Sheer Surfaces \n\nMany surfaces are beyond the means of ordinary characters to climb, and often require specialised training and equipment\\. A sheer cliff with overhangs and no handholds, an icy crevasse, the walls of buildings, or the massive flying buttresses of a hive city are examples of such technical climbs, and attempting a climb like this requires a Hard \\(–10\\) Athletics test\\. With one degree of success, the character completes his climb at a rate of one\\-half his Half Move speed\\. For each further degree of success, the character climbs an additional metre\\. If he fails, the character falls from his starting climbing position\\. Specialised gear items such as grapnels and clip harnesses add bonuses to Athletics tests and are discussed further in Armoury\\. \n\n#### Abseiling \n\nIf a character needs to descend a sheer surface quickly, he can attempt abseiling as opposed to climbing down\\. Abseiling requires climbing gear, a drop harness, or at least a good, stout line, and requires a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Agility test\\. With one degree of success, the character descends at a rate of 10 metres per round, plus an additional metre for every additional degree of success\\. With one degree of failure, the descent rate is reduced to 5 metres per round\\. Failure by two or more degrees requires the character to make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Strength test or lose his grip—and if he is not wearing a drop harness or otherwise secured, he falls from his starting climbing position\\.\n\n## Jumping and Leaping \n\nA jump is a controlled vertical ascent or descent wherein a character attempts to either jump as high as he can, or jump safely down from an elevated surface without taking damage\\. If a character is pushed from a ledge, or is otherwise not in control of his descent, he is not jumping, but falling\\. A leap is a horizontal jump by which a character attempts to cover as much ground as possible\\. Both jumping and leaping can benefit from a running start, and both require a Full Action\\. \n\n### Standing Vertical Jumps \n\nAn average character can jump, from a standing position, roughly one half\\-metre straight up as measured from the ground to the bottom of his feet\\. Jumping distance depends as much on a character's body mass as it does on his Agility or Strength, so this distance tends to vary only slightly among characters\\. A character can jump up to reach an overhead item like a ledge or other handhold that is as high as his own height plus about one metre for average arm length and an additional half\\-metre for the average standing jump\\. A test is not usually required for such a jump, though the GM can call for an Agility test if the character is carrying heavy items, for example\\. Pulling oneself up onto a grabbed ledge requires a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Strength test\\. A character can attempt to safely jump down short distances\\. When a character attempts this, he must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Agility test\\. If he succeeds, he can safely drop a number of metres equal to his Agility bonus, plus 1 metre per degree of success he scored on the test\\. If he fails, he falls Prone and suffers falling damage for the full distance upon impact\\. If he succeeds but does not score enough degrees of success to fall safely, he falls Prone and suffers falling damage for a number of metres equal to the distance he fell minus his Agility bonus\\. \n\n### Running Vertical Jumps \n\nWith a running start of at least four metres in a straight line, a character can increase the height of his jumps\\. At the end of his running jump, the character must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Agility test\\. If he succeeds, he adds a number of metres equal to half of his Strength bonus \\(rounded up\\), plus another half\\-metre for each additional degree of success beyond the first, to his normal vertical jump distance\\. If the character fails the test, he stumbles and must succeed on an additional Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Agility test or fall Prone\\. Either outcome ends the character's turn\\. For every four additional metres beyond the first four that the character runs before making the jump, he receives a \\+10 bonus to his Agility test \\(to a maximum of \\+30\\)\n\n### Standing Horizontal Leaps \n\nTo make a Standing Horizontal Leap, a character must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Agility test\\. If he succeeds, he leaps a number of metres equal to his Strength bonus, plus another half\\-metre for every additional degree of success he scores beyond the first\\. If he fails, the character only leaps a number of metres equal to half of his Strength bonus \\(rounded up\\); each additional degree of failure beyond the first reduces this distance by another half metre \\(to a minimum of one\\-half metre\\)\\. If it is important, the height attained during a leap is equal to one quarter the distance leapt in metres, rounded up\\. \n\n### Running Horizontal Leaps \n\nAs with Running Vertical Jumps, to make a Running Horizontal Leap a character must have a running start of at least four metres in a straight line\\. At the end of the movement, the character makes a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Agility test\\. If he succeeds, he leaps a number of metres equal his Strength bonus, plus another half\\-metre for each additional degree of success beyond the first\\. If he fails, the character only leaps a number of metres equal to half of his Strength bonus \\(rounded up\\); each additional degree of failure beyond the first reduces the distance leapt by another half metre \\(to a minimum of one\\-half metre\\)\\. For every four additional metres beyond the first four that the character runs before making the leap, he receives a \\+10 bonus to his Agility test \\(to a maximum of \\+30\\)\\. If it is important, the height attained during a leap is equal to one quarter the distance leapt in metres rounded up\\.\n\n## Swimming \n\nUnder ideal circumstances a character, does not need to make a tests to swim, but ideal circumstances are rare\\. Rough, choppy seas, restrained hands, heavy burdens, fighting while swimming, and the like are all considered hazardous conditions, and require a character to make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Athletics test as a Full Action to move\\. If the character succeeds, he moves a number of metres equal to one\\-half his Strength bonus \\(rounded up\\) in any direction\\. He can also simply tread water\\. If he fails, the character makes no progress and cannot move\\. A character can also swim underwater, but needs to hold his breath to do so\\. A character who is physically incapable of swimming \\(unconscious, paralysed, bound, etc.\\) automatically sinks\\. While underwater, a character risks Suffocation by drowning\\. \n\nHeavy equipment, especially armour, makes swimming incredibly difficult\\. If a character is wearing armour or is otherwise weighted down \\(at the GM's discretion\\), all Athletics tests are made with a –30 penalty\\. If a character so encumbered fails an Athletics test to swim, he suffers 1 level of Fatigue\\. \n\n### Swimming in Narrative Time \n\nProlonged swimming, no matter the circumstances, is exhausting and potentially dangerous\\. A character can swim without consequence for a number of hours equal to his Toughness bonus\\. After that point, he must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Toughness test at the end of each consecutive hour of swimming with a cumulative –10 penalty on each test beyond the first\\. If a character fails his Toughness test, he gains a level of Fatigue\\. If a swimming character falls unconscious due to Fatigue, he immediately slips beneath the surface and begins to Suffocate as per page 243\\. To determine distance covered for each hour of swimming, use Table 7–24: Narrative Time Movement \\(page 245\\) and use the character's Strength bonus in place of his Agility bonus\\. \n\n## Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Objects \n\nUnder normal circumstances, it is not necessary to know exactly how much a character can carry, and common sense can serve as a guide in most instances\\. In general, an average character can reasonably carry a main weapon, such as a lasgun, autogun, or flamer, plus one or two secondary weapons like a pistol or melee weapon, along with a few clips of extra ammunition and several pieces of miscellaneous equipment in a rucksack, satchel, or similar container\\. It is not at all reasonable, however, for a character, even a very strong one, to be walking around with three heavy weapons and several thousand rounds of ammo for each, or for the character to have a backpack with every item from the gear section of the Armoury\\. There are, however, times when just how much a character can lift or carry is crucial information\\. The amount of weight a character can move is dependent on the sum of his Strength and Toughness bonuses\\. Compare that total to Table Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Limits to find out the limits of a character's might\\. It is important to note that certain traits and talents can increase these values\\. \n\n### Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Limits\n__Sum Of SB And TB__|__Max Carrying Weight__|__Max Lifting Weight__|__Max Pushing Weight__\n----------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------\n0               |0.9kg              |2.25kg            |4.5kg             \n1               |2.25kg             |4.5kg             |9kg               \n2               |4.5kg              |9kg               |18kg              \n3               |9kg                |18kg              |36kg              \n4               |18kg               |36kg              |72kg              \n5               |27kg               |54kg              |108kg             \n6               |36kg               |72kg              |144kg             \n7               |45kg               |90kg              |180kg             \n8               |56kg               |112kg             |224kg             \n9               |67kg               |134kg             |268kg             \n10              |78kg               |156kg             |312kg             \n11              |90kg               |180kg             |360kg             \n12              |112kg              |224kg             |448kg             \n13              |225kg              |450kg             |900kg             \n14              |337kg              |674kg             |1,348kg           \n15              |450kg              |900kg             |1,800kg           \n16              |675kg              |1,350kg           |2,700kg           \n17              |900kg              |1,800kg           |3,600kg           \n18              |1,350kg            |2,700kg           |5,400kg           \n19              |1,800kg            |3,600kg           |7,200kg           \n20              |2,250kg            |4,500kg           |9,000kg           \n\n### Carrying Weight \n\nA character's Carrying Weight is how much he can comfortably carry without suffering Fatigue and penalties to his movement\\. If a character carries more than this weight he is Encumbered\\. \n\n### Lifting Weight \n\nA character's Lifting Weight represents the maximum amount of weight he can pick up off the ground\\. A character may attempt to move while holding a heavy load, but if that load exceeds his Carrying Weight, he is Encumbered\\. Lifting a heavy load is considered a Full Action\\. A character can attempt to lift more than his limit by making a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Strength test\\. For every degree of success he scores, the character adds \\+1 to the sum of his Strength bonus and Toughness bonus for the purpose of determining limits\\. If the character scores two or more degrees of failure, he immediately suffers one level of Fatigue\\.\n\n### Pushing Weight \n\nPushing Weight is the maximum amount of weight a character can push across a smooth surface, like a ship's corridor or the polished stone floor of a dark temple\\. Difficult terrain can make pushing objects difficult or even impossible\\. Pushing an object is a Full Action, and pushing weight up to his limit requires no test\\. Pushing weight that exceeds this limit requires a successful Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Strength test\\. For every degree of success he scores, the character adds \\+1 to the sum of the character's Strength bonus and Toughness bonus for the purpose of determining limits\\. If the character scores two or more degrees of failure, he immediately suffers one level of Fatigue\\. \n\n### Encumbered Characters \n\nA character who attempts to carry more than his normal Carrying Weight, but less than his Lifting Weight, is considered Encumbered\\. While Encumbered, the character suffers a –10 penalty to Agility tests\\. Additionally, after spending a number of hours equal to his Toughness bonus while Encumbered, a character must make a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Toughness test or suffer one level of Fatigue\\. \n\n### Throwing Objects \n\nThere are many weapons, such as grenades and knives, that are designed to be thrown, but a character can attempt to throw nearly any object that weighs up to half of his normal Lifting\\. To throw an object that is not a regular weapon \\(i\\.e\\., not a grenade or knife\\), a character makes a Challenging \\(\\+0\\) Strength test\\. If he succeeds, the object flies a number of metres equal to his Strength bonus\\. For each additional degree of success, this distance is multiplied by the degrees of success \\(one additional degree of success beyond the first doubles the distance, two additional degrees of success beyond the first triples it, and so forth\\)\\. If he fails, the object falls short, flying a number of metres equal to half of his Strength bonus \\(rounded down\\)\\. If this distance is 0 metres, it falls at his feet\\. If the thrown object hits a hard surface such as a wall or vehicle, the surface takes 1d10\\+SB Impact damage plus 1 additional damage for each degree of success past the first\\. If the object is thrown at a specific target, it is treated as an improvised weapon, and the character makes a Ballistic Skill test instead of a Strength test\\. A character can attempt to throw an object that weighs more than half his Lifting Weight, but he must make a Difficult \\(–10\\) Strength test to hurl it successfully\\. See the Armoury for more on using grenades and other Thrown weapons, plus full rules for improvised weapons\\. \n\n## Lighting \n\nPlayers can find themselves participating in night\\-time raids, under black, moonless skies, or infiltrating through dank, foetid sewer systems\\. As a result, the oppressive darkness becomes an enemy in its own right, concealing countless threats and nameless terrors in its inky depths\\. An experienced character knows that a reliable, portable light source like a luminen\\-pack or glow\\-globe is every bit as important as his weapon\\. For ease of play, there are three levels of lighting conditions: Bright, Shadow, and Darkness\\. Bright light is any light that allows for normal vision, such as sunlight, a well\\-lit chamber, or the light of a glow\\-lantern\\. Shadow conditions occur during predawn and twilight hours on Terra\\-like worlds, when a character is just out of range of a light source, or when a light source is obscured by an environmental effect like smoke or fog\\. Darkness is, of course, the absence of light\\. Aside from obscuring vision, Shadow and Darkness conditions also have a deleterious effect on a character's movement and combat capabilities\\. Characters can move through Shadow at full speed with no complications\\. If a character attempts to move faster than half of his Movement rate in Darkness, he must make a Hard \\(–20\\) Perception test to stay on course\\. If he fails, he becomes disoriented and wanders in a randomly determined direction instead of moving toward his goal\\. For the effects of lighting on combat, see Combat\\. \n\n## Flying \n\nThe following section describes the rules that cover everything blessed \\(or cursed\\) with the power of flight, from flying creatures and devices, to characters and NPCs with specific, flight\\-capable technology\\. \n\n### Altitude \n\nOn a typical Terra\\-like planet, there are three broad altitudes: Hovering, Low Altitude, and High Altitude\\. A character who makes a Full Move action while flying can use it to move up or down one altitude level\\. Moving up or down more than one altitude level in a single turn requires a Charge or Run action\\. \n\n#### Hovering Altitude \n\nA hovering character or creature is skimming just above the ground, typically at an altitude of no greater than two metres, and can move over low obstacles with ease\\. It can both attack and be attacked by land\\-bound creatures and characters\\. Often, a creature that can hover cannot fly at other altitudes, as is the case when a creature possesses the Hoverer trait\\. A creature with this trait always stays at roughly the same altitude, roughly two metres above the ground, even if it descends into low terrain like a crater or valley\\. Generally, hovering creatures do not willingly descend into places they cannot escape, as common sense dictates\\. \n\n#### Low Altitude \n\nA character or creature flying at Low Altitude is beyond normal melee range of land\\-bound threats, but still well within range of most ranged attacks from or against such characters or creatures\\. A Low Altitude flier takes no penalties for attacking targets on the ground, but enemies attacking it from ground level suffer a –10 penalty to their Ballistic Skill tests \\(in addition to any normal penalties for range or other factors\\)\\. \n\n#### High Altitude \n\nA character or creature flying at High Altitude is well beyond the reach of any attacks coming from the ground or from Low Altitude\\. Characters or creatures at High Altitude can only attack or be attacked by others at the same altitude\\.\n\n### Flying Movement \n\nFlying characters and creatures are broken into two general categories defined by traits: Hoverers and Flyers\\. Hoverers move through the air, but are limited to an altitude of roughly two metres\\. A Flyer is not limited to ground level, and can ascend or descend to any altitude\\. If included in a creature's profile, each trait has an associated number that dictates that creature's Flying Movement\\. \n\nFlying Movement works just like regular Movement, but only when the creature is airborne\\. While flying, a creature must make at least one Movement action \\(such as Half Move, Full Move, Charge, and Run\\) during each of its turns in flight to stay aloft\\. If a hovering creature suddenly stops flying, due to being Stunned or not devoting a Move action, for example, it simply comes to a safe landing on the ground\\. If it is at Low Altitude instead, it falls to the ground and suffers falling damage as if it fell 15 metres\\. A creature that plummets from High Altitude suffers falling damage as if it fell 25 or more metres, based on the GM's discretion\\.\n\n## The Effects of Gravity \n\nWhile the Imperium's inhabited worlds might vary slightly in gravity, its effects on game play are usually minimal\\. Only when characters visit high gravity or low gravity worlds, or are caught in zero gravity, are movement, lifting, and other factors affected\\. \n\n### Low Gravity Worlds \n\nOn worlds with low gravity, all characters have their Agility bonus increased by 2 for the purposes of Movement and Initiative\\. Characters also have the sum of their Strength and Toughness bonuses increased by 4 for the purpose of determining Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Weights\\. When throwing objects \\(including weapons\\) on low gravity worlds, characters have their Strength bonus increased by 2\\. All Jumping and Leaping distances are doubled when on low gravity worlds\\. \n\n### High Gravity Worlds \n\nOn worlds with high gravity, all characters have their Agility bonus decreased by 2 \\(to a minimum of 1\\) for the purposes of Movement and Initiative\\. Characters also have the sum of their Strength and Toughness bonuses decreased by 4 for the purpose of determining Carrying, Lifting, and Pushing Weights\\. When throwing objects on high gravity worlds, characters have their Strength bonus decreased by 2 \\(to a minimum of 0\\)\\. All Jumping and Leaping distances are halved \\(rounding up\\) when on high gravity worlds\\. \n\n### Zero Gravity \n\nCharacters are most likely to encounter zero gravity in space, especially when there has been a significant technological failure\\. Zero gravity is considered difficult terrain for determining movement, and making a Charge or Run action requires a Hard \\(–20\\) Agility test to avoid drifting off in a random direction\\. Characters who fail the Agility test are also considered Prone\\. A character starting a Move action in zero gravity must be adjacent to a floor, wall, ceiling, deck, or other secure object so that he has something to push off from\\.\n","excerpt":"# Movement   Movement is an important factor, as Players are likely to be in constant motion as they investigate heresies, ferret out clues, and \\(often violently\\) quash those who would imperil Mankind through purposeful direction or foolhardy action\\. There are two different methods of keeping time—narrative time and structured time—and each has its own unique rules regarding movement\\. "},{"srdPath":"core/tests","title":"The Core Mechanic - Tests","content":"# The Core Mechanic - Tests\n\nWhenever a character attempts a task that has some chance of failure, the player who controls that character makes a percentile roll \\(d100\\) called a test to determine the outcome\\. The following steps are used to determine if the character succeeds in a test: \n\n### Determine Value \n\nThe GM selects either the characteristic or skill \\(a characteristic modified by training\\) most appropriate for the task\\. The player then references his character sheet and obtains the value associated with that skill or characteristic\\. This value will be a number between 1 and 100\\. \n\n### Apply Modifiers \n\nThe GM identifies any modifiers that affect the test, both positive and negative\\. Modifiers reflect the inherent difficulty of the task as well as situational and environmental conditions that affect the character performing the task\\. Add all modifiers together to obtain the final modifier\\. Then, the GM adds the final modifier to the value of the characteristic or skill to obtain the target number used for the percentile roll\\. It is possible that the target number will be greater than 100 or less than 0, but the target number is typically between 1 and 100\\. \n\n### Roll Dice \n\nThe player makes a percentile roll as described under Game Dice\\. If the result of the percentile roll is less than or equal to the target number, then the test succeeds\\. Otherwise, the test fails\\. If the result of the percentile roll is 1, the test automatically succeeds, even if the target number is less than 1\\. Likewise, if the result is 100, then the test automatically fails, even if the target number is greater than 100\\.\n\n# Skill Tests\n\nThe skill test is the most common test performed\\. Each skill is governed by a corresponding characteristic, which sets the base level of the skill on a scale of 1–100\\. For example, Dodge is governed by the Agility characteristic, and Scrutiny is governed by the Perception characteristic\\. To make a skill test, the Core Mechanic is used\\. The player first adds all relevant positive and negative modifiers determined by the Game Master to the governing characteristic\\. Once the final result is tallied, the player then makes a percentile roll\\. A skill test succeeds if the result of the percentile roll is equal to or less than the final target number after all modifiers are applied\\. A skill test fails if the result of the percentile roll is higher than the final target number after all modifiers are applied\\. Succeeding at a skill test is always easier if a character has training in the skill being tested\\. A character can attempt to use any skill untrained, but does so at a heavy disadvantage\\. Any attempt to test an untrained skill suffers a –20 penalty in addition to any other penalties\\.\n\n# Characteristic Tests\n\nThere are times over the course of a game when no amount of education or training suffices, and a player must rely simply on raw physical prowess or mental acumen\\. Breaking through a reinforced door or resisting torture are two tasks that call for characteristic tests\\. Again, the Core Mechanic is used\\. First the Game Master determines the most appropriate characteristic for the test, then the player makes a percentile roll\\. If the roll is less than or equal to the characteristic after any modifiers are applied, then the test is successful\\. If the roll is higher than the characteristic after any modifiers are applied, then the test fails\\.\n\n# Automatic Success and Failure\n\nAlthough technically all actions require tests, in practice this would greatly slow down the game and make for an unpleasant and repetitious experience\\. Therefore, particularly simple tests such as driving a ground car along an open road, climbing a ladder, or writing routine reports can be passed automatically, without any test needed\\. A good guideline is that if the test would not have any consequences for failing, the GM should not call for a text\\. On the other hand, the GM might determine that some tasks are so difficult that the character has no chance of success and fails automatically\\. This is to avoid players whose characters have no chance of accomplishing a task attempting to “fish” for a natural 1\\.\n\n# Degrees of Success and Failure\n\nDuring a game, knowing whether a test has succeeded or failed is often sufficient\\. There are times, however, when it is helpful to know just how well a character has succeeded at a given task, or just how badly he has failed\\. This is of particular importance with social skills, such as Charm and Inquiry, as well as during some combat situations such as when firing an automatic weapon, which can score additional hits depending on the roll\\. Measuring a character's degrees of success or failure is a rather straightforward process\\. Once the percentile roll for the test is made, compare the outcome of the roll with the modified characteristic score\\. If the roll is equal to or lower than the characteristic, the character has gained one degree of success \\(DoS\\)\\. He also gains additional degrees of success equal to the tens digit of the target value minus the tens digit of the roll\\. Conversely, if the roll is higher than the characteristic, the character has gained one degree of failure \\(DoF\\), and gains additional degrees of failure equal to the tens digit of the roll minus the tens digit of the target value\\.\n\n# Extended Tests\n\nOccasionally, a character will attempt a task so complicated that it requires quite a length of time to complete\\. In cases such as these, the Game Master can require multiple skill tests to complete the task\\. This is known as an Extended test\\. In general, each skill states within its description whether it requires an Extended test\\. However, the GM should adjust the time represented by each test to best suit the situation and the needs of his campaign\\.\n\n# Opposed Tests\n\nThere are times when a character needs to test himself against a foe, and times like these call for an Opposed test\\. In an Opposed test, each participant makes his appropriate test normally and whoever succeeds wins the test\\. If both parties succeed, the party with the most degrees of success wins the test\\. If the number of successes is equal, then the party with the highest characteristic bonus wins\\. If there is still a tie, then the lowest die roll wins\\. Should both parties fail, then one of two things occurs: either the test ends in a stalemate and nothing happens, or both parties re\\-roll until there is a clear winner\\. Either outcome is appropriate and is left to the GM's discretion\\.\n\n# Test Difficulty\n\nNo two tests are created equal\\. Driving an autocarriage across an open field is one thing, while racing through a ruined, debris\\-choked underhive while under heavy fire is quite another\\. Both require Operate \\(Surface\\) tests, but the latter is demonstrably more difficult than the former\\. The question, however, is just how much harder is it to drive the autocarriage through the underhive? This is where test difficulty and the GM's discretion come into play\\. While the difficulty of a given test is sometimes clearly stated by the rules, often it is left to the GM to determine just how difficult an action is\\. Once the difficulty of a task has been determined, the GM needs to consult Table Test Difficulties to find the appropriate modifier\\. The difficulty modifier is then applied to the governing characteristic associated with the test before the percentile roll is made\\. Some tests can even require multiple modifiers depending on the various factors involved in the attempt\\. In these cases, the modifiers are added to create the final bonus or penalty to be applied\\. Regardless of the source or combined sources, no final bonus can ever exceed \\+60 and no final penalty can exceed –60\\. If no modifier is listed when a test is described, the test begins as Challenging \\(\\+0\\)\\.\n\n## Test Difficulties\n__DIFFICULTY__ | __TEST MODIFIER__\n---|---\nTrivial|\\+60\nElementary|\\+50\nSimple|\\+40\nEasy|\\+30\nRoutine|\\+20\nOrdinary|\\+10\nChallenging|\\+0\nDifficult|–10\nHard|–20\nVery Hard|–30\nArduous|–40\nPunishing|–50\nHellish|–60\n\n# Assistance\n\nAcolytes must depend on each other to succeed, and should always be ready to assist fellow members of their warband to combat the enemies of Mankind\\. There are commonly times during a game when a task will be too great, an obstacle too insurmountable, or an enemy too implacable, for a lone Acolyte to succeed\\. The only way for the players to succeed at such a task is to pool their skills and resources to work together\\. During a complicated or delicate test \\(and with the Game Master's permission\\), the character performing the test can request the assistance of other characters in the group\\. When the percentile roll is made, only the character who is actually making the test rolls the dice, but he gains a \\+10 bonus for each character giving assistance to him\\.\n\n### Limits On Assistance \n\nWhile characters can assist each other in most tasks, there are some restrictions and conditions that must be met: \n\n- To give assistance on a skill test, a character must have training in that skill\\. \n- The assisting character must usually be adjacent to the character performing the test, though certain tests could gain assistance from over a vox channel at the GM's discretion\\. \n- Assistance cannot be given for tests made as part of Reactions or Free Actions\n- Assistance cannot be given on tests made to resist disease, poison, Fear, or anything else the GM deems inappropriate\\. \n- No more than two characters can attempt to assist another on a single test, unless the GM decides otherwise \\(such as if the warband is attempting to right an overturned vehicle\\)\\.\n","excerpt":"# The Core Mechanic - Tests  Whenever a character attempts a task that has some chance of failure, the player who controls that character makes a percentile roll \\(d100\\) called a test to determine the outcome\\.

That's where Background Endeavours come in\\. Background Endeavours aren't a specific kind of Endeavour so much as they are a way to handle Common Endeavours that a Rogue Trader finds menial, beneath his station, or simply boring\\. They reflect the Rogue Trader's ability to let his “people” \\(lackeys, proxies and functionaries\\) handle things he would rather not do himself\\. \n\nOnly Lesser and Greater Common Endeavours can be made Background Endeavours, however, as Grand Endeavours are too complicated and too important to leave to underlings\\. While making a Common Endeavour into a Background Endeavour can free a Rogue Trader up to do things he'd rather do, such as hunting down pirates or plundering backwater planets, the trade\\-off is a reduction in the Profit Factor award and a greater chance that the Endeavour itself will be a failure\\. Making a Common Endeavour a Background Endeavour may get a potentially boring and undesirable task out of the Rogue Trader's hair, but since it's being done essentially unsupervised he can never be sure that it will get done correctly, if at all\\. While avoiding drudge work certainly has its benefits, Background Endeavours have a number of disadvantages that should always be taken into consideration\\. \n\nFirst and foremost, a Background Endeavour will never be as profitable as one undertaken directly by the player\\. Due to the fact that the player is essentially abdicating his responsibility for the Endeavour to a pack of NPCs, there will always be a reduction in the Endeavour's Profit Factor\\. This loss of Profit Factor reflects things like initial outlay of funds for the project, cost of hirelings and things that are missed, miscounted or flat\\-out stolen by the NPCs entrusted with carrying out the task\\. See Background Endeavours and Profit Factor for more information on how the Profit Factor rewards of a common Endeavour are affected by changing it to a Background Endeavour\\. \n\nSecondly, lending credence to the saying that if someone wants something done right they need to do it themselves, whenever a Rogue Trader entrusts his underlings with a task there is a chance that complications could arise\\. No matter how good the underlings, there is always a chance that they will fail in their given task\\. Add to this the fact that the tasks are unsupervised and generally boring and menial, and you have a recipe for potentially spectacular failure\\. Failure by a Rogue Trader's underlings can mean anything from further loss of Profit Factor to embarrassment to the loss of men and material\\. A failure that's spectacular enough may even put an entire Meta Endeavour at risk\\. That's not to say that the effects of an underling's failure can't be mitigated, especially if the Rogue Trader catches the mistake in time\\. More often than not, however, the mistake isn't caught until it's too late and the Rogue Trader and his underlings will be held accountable\\. \n\nAt its heart, the decision to make a Common Endeavour into a Background Endeavour is a strategic one\\. It is also a decision not to be entered into lightly\\. The good that comes out of it: getting someone else to do something a group doesn't want to do and still getting paid for it, is balanced by the bad: loss of Profit Factor and the real possibility of failure and the Rogue Trader having to clean up a mess and do the task anyway\\.\n\n## Background Endeavours And Profit Factor \n\nAs was stated above, a Background Endeavour is never as profitable as a Common Endeavour\\. The first thing that happens when a Common Endeavour becomes a Background Endeavour is that a set number of Profit Factor points are subtracted right off the top, one point for a Lesser Endeavour and two points for Greater Endeavour\\. The initial loss of points can never reduce the Profit Factor of a Background Endeavour to zero\\. This reflects the massive outlay of resources needed to organise a Background Endeavour\\. Furthermore, NPCs will never do more than the bare minimum required to get the job done, this means that there will no extra Achievement Points awarded and therefore none can be traded in for further Profit Factor rewards, reducing the potential profitability of the Endeavour even further\\. Depending on how successful the Endeavour is, or how badly the NPCs fail, more Profit Factor could be lost, even to the point where the players come out upside down on the deal and end up owing money instead of making any\\.\n\n## Making Common Endeavours Into Background Endeavours \n\nOnce the decision has been made to involve NPCs and make a Common Endeavour into a Background Endeavour, steps need to be taken by the Explorers to ensure that the thing gets done correctly\\. \n\n### Marshalling Resources \n\nNow that the decision has been made to make a Common Endeavour into Background Endeavour, the first step toward executing the order is a marshalling of resources\\. During this phase, the Explorers take stock of what they need to complete the Endeavour and what men and materiel they have at hand to commit to it\\. Chances are that the Explorers will have everything that they need, as they should have already planned to complete this as a Common Endeavour and prepared accordingly, and they can continue on with Executing the Orders\\. If this isn't the case, and the Explorers find themselves wanting, they must make Acquisition Tests to gather what they need\\.  When attempting to acquire mercenaries, surveyors, intermediaries or other hired help, the difficulty of the Acquisition Test is modified by the quality of the hirelings\\. A hireling's quality can be poor, common, good or best, and is roughly analogous to an item's Craftsmanship\\.\n\n### Executing The Order \n\nWhen the Explorers have completed marshalling their resources, the player creating the Background Endeavour, typically the Rogue Trader, makes a Command Test\\. This Command Test is modified by two factors, input from other Explorers and the quality of the underlings set to the task\\. Other Explorers may help the character executing the Endeavour by making relevant skill tests and adding bonuses to the Command Test, such as a Navigator making a Navigation Test to double check a Rogue Trader's trade route\\. Each successful Skill Test made by a supporting character adds a \\+10 bonus to the Command Roll\\. \n\nThe quality of people hired to carry out the Endeavour also has an effect on the Command Test\\. See Table Hireling Quality Modifiers for the appropriate bonuses and penalties\\. After all modifiers are applied and the Command Test is made, the player making the Test then tallies up their success or failures to see how well he communicated his orders and how well they'll be followed\\. A simple success nets a flat 50% chance that the Background Endeavour will succeed\\. Every Level of Success attained increases the chances that the Background Endeavour will succeed by one step\\. \n\nIf the player fails his Command Test, the Endeavour still goes forward as planned but every degree of failure increases the likelihood of total failure by one step\\. It is important to note that a failure on this test doesn't necessarily mean the Endeavour fails, although it does increase the chances\\. Instead, it simply means some sort of miscommunication or misunderstanding makes failure more likely\\.\n\n#### Hireling Quality Modifiers\n__Quality of Hireling__|__Command Test Modifier__|__Acquisition Test Modifier__\n---|---|---\nPoor |\\-20 |\\+10\nCommon |\\+0 |\\+0\nGood |\\+10 |\\-20\nBest |\\+20 |\\-30\n\n### Further Modifying The Command Test \n\nIf the Game Master allows it, the Command Test can be further modified by the acquisition of ships or equipment specifically designed for the task at hand\\. For example, hiring a ship specifically built for hauling perishable cargo to haul a load of fresh foodstuffs from one planet to another would grant a \\+10 to the Background Endeavour's Command Test\\. The number of items and the modifiers they provide, if any, are solely the GM's discretion\\.\n\n### Success, Failure, Time and Misfortune \n\nOnce the Command Test has been made and the chance of the Endeavour's success has been recorded, the Explorers' parts in the Endeavour are pretty much at an end\\. The responsibility for the rest of the Endeavour now falls squarely on the Game Master's shoulders\\. There are a number of rolls that the GM needs to make to plot out the events of the Endeavour, and all of them take place out of the sight of the players\\. \n\nThe first and most important roll that the GM has to make is the Endeavour Success Roll\\. After the Explorers made their Command Test, the Game Master records the chance of the Endeavour succeeding, a chance between 10% and 90%\\. The GM rolls d100, and any result under the chance percentage is a success, signifying that the Endeavour goes off without a hitch\\. Rolling above the chance percentage means that the Endeavour is a bust, and the Game Master then rolls on Table Severity of Failure to see just how bad the hired help has failed their employer\\. Once the severity of the failure has been established, the Game Master then either designs a scenario that explains the failure as it fits in with his game, or if he has no explanation, he just determines it randomly, using Table Misfortune Details\\. \n\n#### Severity of Failure\n__d100__  |__Type of Mishap__   |__Profit Factor Lost__                                    \n------|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------\n01-49 |Minor Mishap     |Endeavour fails, but no further profit factor is lost.\n50-65 |Nuisance Mishap  |1                                                     \n66-90 |Grim Mishap      |2                                                     \n90-100|Calamitous Mishap|1d5                                                   \n\nWhether or not the Endeavour succeeds, the Game Master needs to make a roll to see how long the Endeavour takes\\. Every Common Endeavour has, as part of its make up, a stated length of time that the Endeavour should take to complete\\. Underlings or hired help rarely, if ever, can be counted on to complete a task in the time allotted\\. To see how long it takes the underlings to complete their task, the GM rolls on Table Background Endeavour Completion Time\\. This roll is simply a reflection of how quickly a Rogue Trader's underlings follow his orders, and not necessarily indicative of the quality of the work\\. An underling can just as easily cut corners and finish early only to fail as he can take twice as long as the stated time to make sure that everything is just right\\.\n\n#### Background Endeavour Completion Time\n__d100__  |__% of Expected Time__\n------|------------------\n01-10 |25%               \n11-25 |50%               \n26-50 |75%               \n51-70 |100%              \n71-80 |125%              \n81-90 |150%              \n91-100|200%              \n\n### Reaping Rewards and Dealing With Consequences \n\nNow that rolls have been made, success or failure has been determined, time has passed and the Explorers have done what they could to ensure their orders were followed to the letter, the time has come to enjoy the fruits of someone else's labour or to suffer the consequences of abject failure\\. This final phase of the Background Endeavour typically takes place months after the initial rolls were made and while the Explorers have been gallivanting around the galaxy fighting pirates or killing Xenos\\. The final result of the Endeavour is revealed to the Explorers, and they now either collect their Profit Factor or deal with the consequences of their hireling's failure\\. If the Endeavour was successful, the Explorers simply collect their Profit Factor and Achievement Points and go on their way\\. The successful completion of a Background Endeavour also has the possibility of providing the Explorers with useful contacts that they can use in the future\\. For example, the foodstuffs get delivered undamaged and ahead of schedule, netting the Explorers the remainder of their Profit Factor and the 600 Achievement Points for completing a Lesser Endeavour\\. The captain and crew of the merchant ship hired to move the foodstuffs has proven themselves as solid and reliable\\. The relationship between the Explorers and the merchant ship has been extremely amicable and profitable for both sides, and the merchant captain states that he would be more than happy to work with the Explorers whenever they needed him\\.\n\nIf the Endeavour has failed however, a whole new set of problems for the Explorers arises\\. First they need to figure out how much money, if any, has been lost on the Endeavour\\. A failed Endeavour generates no Profit Factor, and depending on the severity of the failure as determined by Table Severity of Failure, the Explorers could end up owing quite a bit of money to creditors and hirelings\\. These bills have no detrimental effect on the Explorers' Profit Factor, but will need to be paid and may have a deleterious effect on their reputations or Meta Endeavour\\. Payment of debts incurred during the course of a Background Endeavour requires a Difficult \\(–10\\) Profit Factor Test for each point of Profit Factor below zero\\. The Explorers can attempt to recoup their losses by either wringing money from the other parties involved in the Endeavour, or by attempting to fix the mistake and salvage what they can from the failed Endeavour\\. This is a perfect opportunity for good role\\-playing and for the characters to use every bit of skill and luck to try to get some benefit from a bad situation\\.\n","excerpt":"# Background Endeavours   There are times when a Rogue Trader needs something to happen, but doesn't have the time or inclination to do it himself\\. That's where Background Endeavours come in\\. Background Endeavours aren't a specific kind of Endeavour so much as they are a way to handle Common Endeavours that a Rogue Trader finds menial, beneath his station, or simply boring\\. They reflect the Rogue Trader's ability to let his “people” \\(lackeys, proxies and functionaries\\) handle things he would rather not do himself\\. "},{"srdPath":"endeavours/common","title":"Endeavours","content":"# Endeavours\n\nIn Rogue Trader, the Player Characters take on the role of interstellar traders, adventurers, and explorers, pushing back the boundaries of the dark frontier and claiming the wealth of whole worlds\\. Theirs is a destiny far removed from the common citizens of the Imperium which will take them across the stars and grant them wealth and power on an unprecedented scale\\. Capturing this grandeur can be challenging for the Game Master, as can bringing to life the layers of servants, holdings, and obligations that the Explorers inherit as part of their dynasty\\. Also, unlike many roleplaying games, the Player Characters are not lone adventurers or even servants of a greater power out solely for personal gain\\. They are part of something much greater—beginning play as already part of a powerful stellar trading family and in command of a near priceless void\\-ship\\. Endeavours are a process intended to help aid the GM in bringing this world of solar cartels and void\\-faring traders to life and to allow the PCs to undertake truly impressive feats worthy of their status as Rogue Traders\\. Core to the concept of the Explorers' wealth is their Profit Factor which charts the power, influence, and raw wealth of their dynasty\\. An Endeavour is an undertaking intended to increase this wealth, geared toward a particular aspect of the Rogue Trader's mission—be it exploration, trade, or conflict\\. While an Endeavour can become an adventure in itself, it can also exist in the background with the PCs offering limited input while pursuing other things\\.\n\n# Creating an Endeavour\n\nThe best way to think of an Endeavour is as a business venture by the Explorers—an investment of time, resources, and sometimes direct influence all intended to turn a profit\\. Endeavours can come about in two ways: either as a result of the plans of the Explorers or as a set scenario created by the GM\\. In both cases, all Endeavours have a number of things in common\\.\n\n## Requirements\n\nAll Endeavours have essential components that the Explorers must have before they can begin\\. Some of these will need to be acquired using their Profit Factor\\. The requirements for an Endeavour can be pretty much anything the GM deems vital to its completion\\. For instance, if the Explorers were undertaking an Endeavour to transport cargo from one system to another, they would require two things: a cargo and a warp\\-capable ship\\. Some requirements the Explorers will already have—like their vessel—while others will need to be either found or acquired\\. Sometimes gathering together the perquisite requirements for an Endeavour can be a mission in itself, as the Explorers chase contracts, seek out ancient warp routes, or haggle over rare cargos\\. How easy or difficult the GM makes meeting the requirements is up to him, but he should remember not to allow the acquiring of requirements to overshadow the Endeavour itself\\.\n\n## Endeavour Size\n\nFor convenience' sake, all Endeavours are placed into three broad rankings: Lesser, Greater, and Grand\\. This serves as a guide for both the GM and players as to how difficult the Endeavour will be to complete and how much it will increase their Profit Factor\\. These varying sizes are, of course, only presented as a guide, and the GM should feel free to scale Endeavours as he sees fit, setting his own difficulty, duration, and Profit actor increase\\.\n\n#### Lesser\n\nThese Endeavours should only last a session or two and should be relatively simple to complete—such as completing a cargo run or scouting a small and relatively harmless world\\. Completing a Lesser Endeavour should increase Profit actor by 1 or 2 points\\.\n\n#### Greater\n\nThese Endeavours are proportionally more difficult and will require at least a few sessions to complete— such as purging a system of xeno influence or charting a new warp route\\. Completing a Greater Endeavour should increase Profit actor by 3 or 4 points\\.\n\n#### Grand\n\nThese are the most challenging of Endeavours and will always have numerous parts and obstacles to overcome— such as restoring a Calixis noble house to glory or settling an entire star system\\. Completing a Grand Endeavour should increase Profit actor by 5 points or more\\.\n\n## Objectives\n\nTo make the GM's job easier, Endeavours can be broken down into parts called objectives\\. Each objective is a waypoint or minor goal within the greater undertaking, each of which must be overcome by the Explorers before the Endeavour is complete\\. For example, an Endeavour requiring the rescue of an Explorator Mission on a remote death world might be broken down into finding the world, braving the death world to find the Mission, and escaping the system with the Mission on board\\. Typically, an Endeavour is divided into three objectives—though this is just a guide and the GM can either increase or decrease this amount to suit his purposes\\.\n\n## Achievement Points\n\nTo help the GM determine when the Explorers have successfully completed an objective—and by extension an Endeavour—he can use Achievement Points\\. These points are awarded for completing individual tasks and overcoming obstacles toward resolving the Endeavour\\. Each Endeavour has an overall amount of points required to complete it, which in turn are divided amongst its objectives\\. When the Explorers have amassed enough points within an objective, they will have completed it and may move on to the next objective—until they complete the last one and complete the Endeavour\\. Table Endeavour Scale details the number of Achievement Points a group of explorers needs to accumulate based on the size of an Endeavour\\. Once the GM knows how many Achievement Points an Endeavour is worth, he should divide them equally among its objectives—so for example, for a Greater Endeavour with three objectives, each one would be worth 400 points\\. If he chooses, the GM can “stack” Endeavour Points into certain objectives, making them harder and longer to complete to represent their importance\\. Thus, the same Greater Endeavour could have three objectives worth 200, 600, and 400 points, respectively, reflecting comparatively how involved they are\\.\n\n### Endeavour Scale\n__Size__   |__Achievement Points Needed__\n-------|-------------------------\nLesser |900                      \nGreater|1200                     \nGrand  |1500                     \n\n### Awarding Achievement Points\n\nDuring the course of an Endeavour, the GM awards Achievement Points whenever the Explorers overcome a challenge or encounter related to the Endeavour\\. The amount of points they receive is based on the difficulty of the encounter or challenge\\. The GM should use Table Achievement Point Awards as a guide for awarding Achievement Points to the Explorers\\. As a benchmark, an encounter that requires some effort on the part of the Explorers but places them in no real peril is counted as Ordinary\\. It falls to the GM, however, to decide the difficulty of each encounter based on the amount of resources, danger, and effort required on the part of the Explorers\\.\n\n#### Achievement Point Awards\n__Encounter Difficulty__|__Points Awarded__\n--------------------|--------------\nEasy                |10            \nRoutine             |30            \nOrdinary            |50            \nChallenging         |100           \nDifficult           |150           \nHard                |200           \nVery Hard           |300           \n\n\n### Objective Themes\n\nObjective themes act as a guide for the GM and players as to the nature of the objective and the kinds of resources the Explorers will need to accomplish the objective\\. Themes also have an effect on the amount of Achievement Points earned when an objective is completed by Explorers with certain Talents or Ship Components keyed to the objective\\. The five most common objective themes include:\n\n#### Military \n\nMilitary objectives have to do with combat, confrontation, defence, or any involvement of an organised military force such as the Imperial Guard\\. \n\n#### Criminal\n\nCriminal objectives are often associated with underworld contacts, such as pirates, underhive scum, corrupt officials, and smugglers\\. \n\n#### Exploration\n\nExploration objectives have to do with the uncharted reaches of the galaxy\\. Discovering a new warp route, plotting the location of bizarre celestial phenomena, or recording the passage through a particularly dangerous asteroid field are all examples of Exploration objectives\\. \n\n#### Trade\n\nTrade objectives rely upon economics\\. Supply and demand, providing services or goods that no one else can or will, or convincing polar region natives to purchase cryo\\-vaults all fall under this heading\\. \n\n#### Creed\n\nCreed objectives are focused on religion\\. Spreading the faith of the Ministorum, erecting a massive idol for a feral tribe's worship, or serving the interests of a radical sect are all examples of this theme\\.\n\n## Setting up Endeavours\n\nAn Endeavour can come about through the actions of the Explorers, or it can be set up by the GM\\. For example, the PCs might decide they want to increase the wealth of their dynasty and, as a result, decide to seek out worlds to exploit within the Koronus Expanse\\. This desire would then prompt the GM to create an Endeavour to help them realise their ambition\\. Equally, the GM might come up with a plot that revolves around the Cold Trade between the Expanse and the Calixis Sector and decide to create an Endeavour which will then be presented to the PCs through the course of play\\. However the seed of an Endeavour is planted, the GM can cultivate it using the elements and guidelines presented in this section\\. Use the following checklist when developing an idea into an Endeavour: \n\n- __Determine the size of the Endeavour \\(Lesser, Greater, or Grand\\):__ This is the point where the GM decides how time\\-consuming, difficult, and ultimately rewarding the Endeavour will be\\. \n- __Set any requirements such as goods, allies, or worlds:__ Requirements should represent the bare minimum that the Explorers need to embark on the Endeavour\\. \n- __Divide the Endeavour into objectives:__ Most Endeavours naturally fall into equal parts; however, the GM may want to single out special sections of an Endeavour as particularly hard or challenging\\. \n- __Tally up Achievement Points:__ These can either be based on the size of the Endeavour or can be set by the GM\\. The points are then divided among the objectives either equally or based on each objective's importance\\. \n- __Assign any appropriate themes to the Endeavour's objectives:__ These will help set the tone for the Endeavour and its parts, giving a broad feel for what kind of approach the Explorers will need to take\\. Once these basic elements are in place, the GM can flesh out the Endeavour as required for his purposes\\.\n\n### Running Endeavours\n\nThere are two ways for the GM to run an Endeavour: either in the foreground as a full\\-blown adventure or in the background as part of the workings of the Explorers' dynasty with NPCs handling most of the legwork and heavy lifting\\. Endeavours run in the foreground are much like any other kind of adventure with the Explorers directly involved in the action and making decisions as challenges arise to thwart them\\. These kinds of Endeavours can, therefore, be treated as adventures and centered around the PCs\\.  By contrast, Endeavours run in the background occur during downtime—either at the start or end of a play session or between the action of the Explorers' own adventures\\. These kinds of undertakings are run by NPCs, allies, and the faceless legions of the PCs' dynasty, with only a small degree of direction from the players themselves\\. As a general rule, Endeavours run by subordinates will always be more problematic—a fact the Explorers should learn during the course of their dynasty's rise to glory\\. They should also take longer and be less profitable than those that the Explorers take a hand in personally—after all, if you want a job done right… \n\nRegardless of how the GM chooses to run an Endeavour, he should remember that it is a tool intended to help him capture the scale and grandeur of what it means to be a Rogue Trader and deal in the fates of worlds\\. It should not supplant the GM's own plots or the PCs' own style of play\\. For this reason, each group should decide amongst themselves how they want to use Endeavours\\.\n\n### Resolving Endeavours\n\nAn Endeavour is completed when the Explorers have resolved each of the Endeavour's objectives as a result of earning enough Achievement Points\\. Excess Achievement Points earned in one objective carry over into the next\\. It is possible that the Explorers will fail to complete an objective within an Endeavour for one reason or another—perhaps a colony they were meant to save is destroyed or a shipment of rare cargo lost to the warp\\. In these cases, the GM can allow the Explorers to still complete the overall Endeavour by gaining enough Achievement Points from the remaining objectives\\. It can be imagined that they shift their efforts and adapt to the changing situation—exploiting new avenues of profit or shifting their direction of attack\\. At the end of an Endeavour, it is possible that the Explorers have amassed more Achievement Points than they require\\. In this case, excess Achievement Points can be converted into Profit\\. For every full 100 Achievement Points they have beyond what is necessary to accomplish the Endeavor, they gain an additional \\+1 to their Profit Factor\\.\n","excerpt":"# Endeavours  In Rogue Trader, the Player Characters take on the role of interstellar traders, adventurers, and explorers, pushing back the boundaries of the dark frontier and claiming the wealth of whole worlds\\.

Incidental passengers are easy to find, but an Endeavour requires greater diversity of effort. The Rogue Trader needs a suitable colony world, connections with beast hunters, explorers, and nobles, signed pilgrim-compacts with sects of the Imperial Cult, and agreements with the Great Houses.\n\nExample Requirements:\n* A suitable world\n* Preliminary surveys to confirm viability for habitation\n* Colony hab-installations\n* Atmosphere-machines or other protective devices\n* A binding compact with the Machine Cult to support colony machinery\n* A partnership with high functionaries in the Calixis Sector, such as leaders in the Ministorum or a Great House, who desire a colony established in their name\n* An organisation of negotiators and brokers to accept Thrones for passage for would-be colonists and to negotiate a wide range of one-time transport compacts with Imperial organisations.\n\n### The First Colony of Grace\n\n_Greater Endeavour, +4 Profit Factor_\n\nThe Lady Aspyce Chorda used her connections with the Cold Guild and other shadowy organisations to ferry wealthy fugitives from Imperial justice to the Foundling World of Grace. The fugitives themselves paid for their fortified, palatial colony structures, whilst Chorda provided slaves from a variety of unsavoury sources. She profited greatly until the ravening Orks laid waste to Grace.\n\n#### Objective 1: Confirm Grace as a Suitable Colony World\n\n__Themes:__ Exploration\n\nExplorers and surveyors must descend like thistle down from the Rogue Trader's vessel, and all signs of toxins, taint, and unholy 280 IX: Playing the Game presences investigated. Who knows what might be missed if hirelings are left to complete these tasks unsupervised.\n\n#### Objective 2: Establish Dominance Over the Cold Guild\n\n__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade\n\nThe fiercely independent Cold Guild representatives must be made to bow to the Rogue Trader's will, either through respect or terror of the consequences of resistance.\n\n#### Objective 3: Cleanse the Near Voids of Pirate Scum\n\n__Themes:__ Exploration, Military\n\nNo Foundling World is safe whilst reavers of Iniquity roam its system voids with impunity. Their vessels must be found and their leaders made to fear the Rogue Trader's presence.\n\n### The Second Colony of Grace\n\n_Lesser Endeavour, +2 Profit Factor_\n\nAt some point in time, the ruins of Grace become attractive to a different Rogue Trader, one who sees Profit Factor in raising up a more holy colony in the God-Emperor's name.\n\n#### Objective 1: Crush the Feral Orks Who Infest the Ruins\n\n__Themes:__ Military\n\nThe Imperial ruins of Grace are overrun with tribes of feral Orks, the cast-off seeds of past battles. They must be purged from this world and their spores charred from the ground where they lie.\n\n#### Objective 2: Forge an Alliance with a Ministorum Cult\n\n__Themes:__ Creed\n\nThe Rogue Trader must obtain allies and succeed in negotiations such that the Drusians or Vitrian Covenant open their coffers in support of the Rogue Trader's goals and exhort their followers in pilgrimage to this new world.\n\n#### Objective 3: Raise up the Pilgrim Horde\n__Themes:__ Creed, Trade\n\nFrom the faithful of Port Wander and Footfall, the Rogue Trader must gather a pilgrim horde to fill great-holds with prayer and find Ecclesiarchs to lead them. The Rogue Trader must convince them to empty their purses for passage, carry them to Grace, and settle them in new colony-habs and shrines.\n\n## Exploit a Resource World\n\nUncharted worlds host strange xenos beasts, rare ores, gems, and a hundred other natural riches. To exploit such a resource, the Rogue Trader must set down workers and installations from orbit and later return to the world to carry away the riches. Connections must be set up with factors and merchant houses of the Drusus Marches to obtain the best price for the materials brought back to civilisation.\n\nExample Requirements:\n* A resource world\n* Wide-ranging survey expeditions carried out to identify and characterise resources\n* Mineheads, refineries, macroharvesters, hunting bases, or other appropriate resource installations\n* Bulk lift transports to carry material to orbit\n* A binding compact with the Machine Cult to support necessary machinery\n* A population of labourers and specialists\n* A small organisation of brokers and scribes to manage the flow of resources\n* Secure storage vaults in Port Wander\n* Compacts of trade struck with factors and influential merchant houses of the Drusus Marches, or a trade alliance with a great organisation, such as the Machine Cult of a forge world, a Great House, or Departmento Munitorum.\n\n### Establish a Beast Trade from the Unvisited World of Tvalde IV\n\n_Greater Endeavour, +3 Profit Factor_\n\nImperial circuses and Magi-Xenobiologis of the Machine Cult are ever hungry for new xenos beasts. The death worlds of Burnscour and Valcetti's Salvation are known now, if not completely catalogued. New and unexpected horrors must be found on unexplored worlds of the Koronus Expanse if greater profit is to be made.\n\n#### Objective 1: Locate Tvalde IV and Catalogue Its Worst Horrors\n\n__Themes:__ Exploration\n\nMentioned only once in the logs of Parsimus Dewain and nowhere else, this dread and rumoured deathworld must be located in the voids. Thence, explorers, factors, and hunters experienced in the beast trade can be carried there to assess the vile, deadly xenos and determine from what regions and breeds the best profit can be made.\n\n\n#### Objective 2: Gain Powerful Beast Trade Allies\n\n__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade\n\nThe beast trade of the Drusus Marches is as much criminal as legitimate. The black markets and forbidden forms of xenos are where the greatest reward—and the greatest risk—lie. Profit demands that alliances be made on both sides of Imperial justice, and they must be influential, perhaps dangerous, figures in order to provide the level of recompense a Rogue Trader desires: Imperial Governors, Archmagi, crime barons of the Kasballica, and others.\n\n#### Objective 3: Cull the Dread Herds\n\n__Themes:__ Exploration, Military\n\nIn the company of many hunters and other militants, protected by Imperial tech-devices, the Rogue Trader's mission must slaughter and capture terrifying beasts to fill great-holds many times over. Further, the bases for future expeditions must be established and the results of this grand hunt brought back to Imperial space for the profit they will bring.\n\n### Enter the Nephium Trade of Lucin's Breath\n\n_Lesser Endeavour, +2 Profit Factor_\n\nThe Winterscale lineage has for centuries benefited from pure nephium found on the frozen resource world of Lucin's Breath, using it to gain favour with forge world Archmagi. Vast refineries, drill-machinery, and bulk-lifter ruins from years long past litter Lucin's Breath, and tens of thousands of serfs and slaves toil within presently active installations. Yet there is still room for a new Rogue Trader to violently establish a refinery zone.\n\n#### Objective 1: Make Your Mark and Clear the Zone\n\n__Themes:__ Military\n\nClear a new sinkhole refinery zone of frozen battle-debris, and burn down incursions by the slave-forces of Winterscale and Chorda to establish that this Rogue Trader is here to stay.\n\n#### Objective 2: Tame the Lucinite Xenos\n\n__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade\n\nForcing the Lucinite breed to toil in the frigid gas-snow outside Imperial installations is a great advantage and is necessary to success on Lucin's Breath now that Rogue Traders vie for its treasure with such great violence. The secrets of their slavery must be wrested from other Rogue Traders' servants, and a cadre of xenos-trainers established.\n\n#### Objective 3: Challenge the Rival Rogue Traders\n\n__Themes:__ Military, Trade\n\nUnless partnership, dominance, respect, or fear is established, then the new installations will soon enough be destroyed from orbit by the void-ships of Lady Aspyce Chorda or Lord-captain Calligos Winterscale. The Rogue Trader must seek out these rivals and force a better outcome.\n\n## Establish a Cold Trade from Dead Xenos Worlds\n\nThe “Cold Trade” is the name given to the black market in xenos materials, much of it illegal despite the terms of a Rogue Trader's Warrant of Trade. Xenos artefacts are rarer than common resources, but also more dangerous to trade within the Imperium. A Rogue Trader must make diligent efforts to develop a secure web of connections to smugglers and crime barons of the Cold Trade, as well as to wealthy collectors and xenosavants.\n\nExample Requirements:\n* Xenos worlds, usually long dead\n* Initial archeo-excavations and site surveys to identify potentially valuable artefacts\n* Base installations and exploration vehicles\n* A few orbital shuttle vehicles\n* A binding compact with the Machine Cult to support necessary machinery\n* Well-equipped groups of explorers and savants\n* Secure relationships with a few highly placed and influential collectors or savants of xenos works, or with diverse Cold Trade smugglers and collectors of the forbidden.\n \n### A Cold Trade from the Blasted Cineris Malificum\n\n_Grand Endeavour, +5 Profit Factor_\n\nIn the 5th century M41, Balastus Irem established a fantastically lucrative Cold Trade in horrid artefacts recovered from cyclopean ruins upon dead worlds of the Cineris Malificum. His coffers swelled enormously as a result of this Endeavour. Little is known of the details of Balastus Irem's allies, trade partners, voyages, and archeo-excavations, for Ordo Xenos forces expunged the Irem lineage and all their works in 443.M41, on suspicion of the most dire heresy.\n\n#### Objective 1: Establish Promising Archeosites\n\n__Themes:__ Exploration\n\nThe ruins of the Cineris Malificum worlds are so ancient and vast they have become hills and valleys. Past archeosites are visible from orbit, some blasted in unknown assaults. New dig sites must be located, and a horde of explorers and savants unleashed upon these dread worlds to find the most promising locations for new discoveries. Dangers and eldritch horrors of an ancient xenos past that have claimed previous expeditions must be evaded or overcome. Eldar may appear and attempt to warn off, assassinate, or threaten explorers.\n\n#### Objective 2: Develop a Cold Trade Network of Wealthy Clients\n\n__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade\n\nThere is great risk attendant on entering the Cold Trade,even for a Rogue Trader. Potential buyers of great wealth and influence must be approached with caution—lest the Imperial authorities hear of these activities and lest the shadowy powers of the Drusus Marches underworld intervene. There are guides through this dangerous underworld, such as the Kasballica representatives of Footfall, but even they are difficult to approach.\n\n#### Objective 3: Defeat the Treacherous Eldar\n\n__Themes:__ Military\n\nThe Eldar have some unknown interest in the dead worlds of the Cineris Malificum, and their ghost-vessels have been known to assault Rogue Traders who mine xenos tombs for artefacts and strange sigils. The Eldar must be driven back when they appear in force.\n\n### A Cold Trade in Materials of the Egarian Dominion\n\n_Greater Endeavour, +3 Profit Factor_\n\nThe strange hive-ruins of the deserted Egarian worlds are formed of a strange material that can generate great wealth when provided to the right organisations. Sometimes artefacts are found in the empty, wind-wracked structures, and these rare items can be yet more lucrative. A number of Rogue Traders have participated in the Egarian Cold Trade over the centuries, enough for established buyers and traditions to exist at the edges of Imperial society.\n\n#### Objective 1: Establish a Warp Route to the Egarian Worlds\n\n__Themes:__ Exploration\n\nThe shifting warp of Winterscale's Realm and the obsessive secrecy of those who harrow xenos worlds leaves navigation to the Egarian Dominion an uncertain proposition. A route must be established through the dangers of the Empyrean of the Expanse and the strange warp-phenomena that surround the Egarian stars. There are ugly currents in these voids that few Rogue Traders are willing to speak of, and some voidfarers believe them haunted.\n\n#### Objective 2: Develop a Cold Trade Network of Wealthy Clients\n\n__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade\n\nThe trade in Egarian materials is presently accepted as falling within the bounds of a Warrant of Trade, and so has far less attendant risk than selling other xenos artefacts. Nonetheless, few potential buyers stand on the right side of Imperial authority. A Rogue Trader will often find himself forging an unwilling compact of trade with the Kasballica to generate the profit he desires.\n\n#### Objective 3: Seek Out Value in the Hive-ruins\n\n__Themes:__ Exploration\n\nLed by rare savants of Egarian lore, the Rogue Trader's mission must enter or even tear apart the hive-ruins of an Egarian world in search of the shards, sheets, and artefacts valued by the Cold Trade. This is dangerous toil, wherein explorers are under threat of becoming lost forever in the crumbling hive-mazes, or crushed and sliced apart by falling shards. Expeditions past have vanished utterly upon these worlds, leaving only deserted camps behind them, and no one knows what has become of such unfortunate souls. Something preys upon those who come here; that much is certain.\n\n## Establish a Trade Route\n\nEstablishing a reliable path through the treacherous warp is but the first part of building a trade route. Desirable goods must be identified, which usually requires local knowledge, and trade must be supported by compacts negotiated with rulers, merchants, and law-wrights; that process can be costly. The Degree of the Endeavour depends on what is traded, the level of competition from other traders, and the terms of the compacts: no potentate will stand idle whilst traders make wealth for themselves. A large cut is always expected, one way or another.\n\nExample Requirements:\n* Two or more human worlds\n* Identified warp routes between the worlds\n* Compacts of trade negotiated with leaders upon each world\n* A modest organisation of factors and negotiators upon each world\n* A small organisation of brokers and scribes\n* Secure storage vaults upon each world\n* A compact of partnership with a great organisation, such as a Great House or the Munitorium, who will benefit from this trade\n\n### Create a Macrocannon Trade Route from Zayth\n\n_Grand Endeavour, +5 Profit Factor_\n\nGiven time, Jonquin Saul—or perhaps another Rogue Trader—will establish a profitable trade route to the Heathen Stars.Perhaps it will involve the weapon manufactories of Zayththat produce vast macrocannons of a pattern unknown to theCalixis Sector. Saul is still in the early stages of establishing allies amongst the heathens of that world, however. It is a delicate process, for the coming of outsiders has roiled the heathen cultures.\n\n#### Objective 1: Establish a Warp Route to Zayth\n\n__Themes:__ Exploration\n\nLong routes through the turbulent warp of the Koronus Expanse are a dire and terrifying prospect, and the Heathen Stars are far indeed from Footfall, far even from the better known worlds of Winterscale's Realm. A route must be established, however, and potential dangers and layover worlds along the way explored. These are treacherous, unknown voids, and almost anything might emerge to threaten an exploring fleet\n\n#### Objective 2: Gain Allies Amongst the Zaythi Powers\n\n__Themes:__ Creed, Military, Trade\n\nGaining the trust of any Zaythi faction is a grand challenge. Their world is roiled, its hive vehicles set against one other, and the old ways falling apart. Perhaps a deal can be struck in propping up a losing faction, in creating zealots of the Imperial Creed amongst forsaken Zaythi, in striking down an enemy hive vehicle, or in overturning a hated organisation.\n\n#### Objective 3: Aid the Zaythi Against the Orks\n\n__Themes:__ Military\n\nTo seal the compacts of trade, it is necessary to perform a great deed of vengeance against the green-skinned demons who fall from the sky—the terrible Orks. Zathyi allies wish to accompany the Rogue Trader's force away from Zayth to witness a strike against the Ork foe in the name of the Silvered God of War.\n\n### Forge a Guilder's Route from Port Wander to the Drusus Marches\n\n_Lesser Endeavour, +2 Profit Factor_\n\nWhen needs must, a Rogue Trader can act in the manner of a common Free Trader or Chartist Captain and use his influence to carry rarities from the storehouses of Port Wander to the churning markets of Drusus Marches hives. He will be scorned by his peers, and mocked behind his back by the very merchants he associates with, but a path to wealth is a path to wealth.\n\n#### Objective 1: Ally with Greater Rogue Traders\n\n__Themes:__ Trade\n\nTo ensure a great enough flow of rarities and favoured pick of strange goods, the Rogue Trader must go before his peers for assistance. Some Rogue Traders are reluctant to enter into such compacts, either through suspicion or a misplaced sense of loyalty to the ideal of the Warrant of Trade.\n\n#### Objective 2: Establish a Hive World Market\n\n__Themes:__ Criminal, Trade \n\nThe Rogue Trader and his factors must descend upon a hive world of the Drusus Marches and there forge a reliable market of buyers and client organisations for this trade. Hive worlds are vile nests of devious law-wrights, scheming nobles, and guilders who think nothing of ruining all who leave themselves open to assault. Treachery and well-dressed thieves must be overcome in order to find those whose remnant honesty or greed will keep them loyal.\n\n#### Objective 3: Defend the Reputation of the Lineage\n\n__Themes:__ Creed, Trade\n\nBold action must be taken in Port Wander to ensure that the Rogue Trader does not become an outcast amongst Imperial nobility and the high functionaries of the Port. The Rogue Trader's name is threatened by undertaking common trade between worlds. Other Rogue Traders, like Jonquin Saul, have overcome a Free Trader's origins and gained respect—so it can be done. Largess, obtaining noble allies through means fair and foul, and many other strategies are possible.\n","excerpt":"# Example Endeavours  Presented below is a selection of these Endeavour types and their requirements, as well as a number of specific Endeavours for each, is presented here for the GM to either use as is or to draw inspiration from."},{"srdPath":"endeavours/meta","title":"Meta Endeavours","content":"# Meta Endeavours \n\nMeta Endeavours are campaign\\-level Endeavours in which the Explorers take an active role\\. Each Meta Endeavour is made up of a number of separate Common Endeavours that are all part of a common theme\\. They grant a Game Master the tools with which to create an epic Rogue Trader campaign that provides both distinct goals that the Explorers need to meet to advance the story and the freedom to achieve these goals in whatever way they see fit\\. Like Common Endeavours, Meta Endeavours have a set number of Achievement Points that the Explorers need to collect to successfully complete them\\. These Achievement Points are accrued both through completion of the separate Common Endeavours as well as by completing smaller tasks which can grant small amounts of Achievement Points at the discretion of the Game Master\\. \n\n## Creating Meta Endeavours\n\nCreating a Meta Endeavour is a laborious but ultimately satisfying project for both Game Masters and players\\. They are typically designed solely by the GM after discussions with his players regarding the scope and type of campaign they are looking for\\. For the Explorers, it gives them an idea about what characters would be appropriate and fun to play in the campaign, as well as an idea of what to expect from the GM\\. It also provides tangible goals for them to work toward, which ultimately helps the Game Master move the game along\\. For the Game Master, Meta Endeavours grant a broad framework to work within that grants both definite progress benchmarks and the freedom to alter them to best suit the direction the Campaign takes over the course of its life\\. \n\n## Meta Endeavour Scope\n\nThe first thing to consider when designing a Meta Endeavour is the scope\\. A Meta Endeavour's scope tells the GM and players approximately how long and involved the campaign will be\\. It gives a rough idea of the number and type of Common Endeavours required for success, and how much the Explorers will gain in both Profit Factor and reputation\\. The following Scopes, much like the size guidelines for Common Endeavours, are only guidelines for the GM to follow\\. Game Masters should feel free to alter the size and requirements of the scopes to better fit their styles along with the playing styles of their players\\. \n\n### Monumental\n\nMeta Endeavours with a Monumental Scope typically last for a few months to a year and are confined to one small part of space\\. A good example would be the charting of a new star cluster in the Koronus Expanse and opening it up to trade\\. They will have six to eight Lesser and Greater Endeavours as their primary requirements, as well as numerous random encounters as they arise\\. Monumental Scale Endeavours tend to be part of larger campaigns, and can be combined with other Monumental or Legendary Endeavours as the Game Master sees fit\\. \n\n### Legendary\n\nLegendary Scope Meta Endeavours can take anywhere from one to two years and could require the Explorers to cross and re\\-cross Imperial Space to achieve their goals\\. For example, the Rogue Trader and his crew have been tasked with scouring the entirety of the Koronus Expanse in search of ancient technology at the behest of the Adeptus Mechanicus\\. Legendary Meta Endeavours will have eight to twelve Lesser and Greater Endeavours \\(and possibly one or two Grand Endeavours\\) as their primary requirement, as well as numerous random encounters\\. Legendary Meta Endeavours, like their smaller Monumental Scale cousins, can be combined as the GM sees fit to make their campaign\\. \n\n### Epic\n\nEpic Meta Endeavours are extremely arduous and rewarding Imperium\\-spanning campaigns that can last for years\\. Explorers will take part in events that have the ability to change the galaxy as they know it, events that could make them unimaginably wealthy and bring them to the attention of highest members of the Imperial government\\. A Meta Campaign with a truly Epic Scope could be one in which the Explorers set out to pacify the entirety of the Koronus Expanse in hopes of setting themselves up as its undisputed rulers\\. Such a campaign would consist of twelve to sixteen Common Endeavours of each type along with countless side adventures and random encounters\\. \n\n## Grand Endeavours as Part of Meta Endeavours \n\nGrand Endeavours are never used in Monumental Meta Endeavours, and only rarely in Legendary ones\\. They are used in the construction of Epic Meta Endeavours, but even then the Game Master should use them sparingly\\. Thanks to their size, complexity and potential profitability, they should be reserved for the final, grand undertaking needed to complete a Legendary Meta Endeavour or used as major story line or “chapter” breaks in an Epic Meta Endeavour\\. For example, if the Game Master is running an Epic Scale Meta Endeavour in which the ultimate goal is the total obliteration of a Tyranid Hive Fleet, one of the Grand Endeavours contained within could require the players to find and destroy advanced flotillas of Genestealers that are flooding into a nearby system\\.\n\n## Designing Component Endeavours And Objectives \n\nOnce the Scope of the Meta Endeavour has been agreed on, the GM must decide on the Endeavour's Objectives\\. These objectives consist of the numerous Common Endeavours that make up the bulk of the Meta Endeavour\\. These Common Endeavours are designed using the Endeavour rules found above, and function largely the same way that Objectives do in a Common Endeavour\\. Each Common Endeavour within a Meta Endeavour acts as a waypoint, a benchmark by which the Explorers can measure their progress through the campaign\\. When a Common Endeavour is completed, it is resolved as normal\\. Achievement Points are recorded and any Profit Factor gained is added to the group's Profit Factor pool\\. The Game Master may also organise the Common Endeavours into groups linked by the themes usually assigned to Common Endeavour Objectives\\. These groups make up chapters within the Meta Endeavour, and are an easy tool to use to frame the rough order in which Common Endeavours need to be undertaken\\. \n\n## Achievement Points \n\nJust as Common Endeavours require Achievement Points to complete, so too do Meta Endeavours\\. Achievement Points are rewarded for completing the Lesser and Greater Endeavours that make up the Meta Endeavour, along with the numerous side adventures and random encounters that come up during any game session\\. See Table Endeavour Scope and Table Achievement Point Awards for rules regarding the awarding of Achievement Points for both Common Endeavours and random encounters\\. Each kind of Meta Endeavour has a set number of Achievement Points needed to complete it, dictated by the average number of Common Endeavours involved and their Achievement Point rewards\\. See Table Meta Endeavour Scope for the number of Achievement Points needed to complete each type of Meta Endeavour\\. \n\n### Meta Endeavour Scope\n__Scale__|__Achievement Points Needed__\n---|---\nMonumental|10000\nLegendary|15000\nEpic|20000\n\n## Meta Endeavour Check List \n\nThe following check list is a quick reference for Game Masters to aid them in creating their Meta Endeavours\\. \n\n- Determine the Scope of the Meta Endeavour \\(Monumental, Legendary or Epic\\): The Game Master and his players discuss what they want from a game, the length of the campaign \\(roughly\\) and appropriate characters\\. Once all of this is agreed on the Game Master chooses the Scope that fits his campaign best\\. Choosing the Scope of the Meta Endeavour determines approximately how long it will take, along with the difficulty and Achievement Point Requirements\\. \n- Design Component Common Endeavours: Based on the Meta Endeavour's Scope, the Game Master sets about designing the Common Endeavours that will form the body of the Meta Endeavour\\. The GM may also make notes about possible side adventures and random encounters that he would like to include in the Endeavour\\. \n- Divide the Meta Endeavour into Objectives and Assign Themes: Once the component Endeavours have been designed, the GM can now group them together based on common themes to form chapters within his Meta Endeavour\\. Once all of the pieces have come together and the Game Master has a good idea of how he'd like things to go, the Meta Endeavour is ready to be played\\. \n\n## Resolving Meta Endeavours \n\nDepending on the Scope of the Meta Endeavour, the resolution could simply have been one section of a grander idea forged by the Game Master, or the culmination of years of play that ends with the Explorers becoming major intergalactic figures, unimaginably wealthy and powerful\\. Whatever the case, the Explorers have completed near superhuman tasks and deserve every reward that is coming to them\\. In the case of Monumental and Legendary Scale Endeavours, the Achievement Points gained over the course of the Meta Endeavour are totaled and compared to the base Acquisition Point requirement\\. Like a regular Common Endeavour, Meta Endeavours can still be completed even if the Explorers fail at one or more of the component Endeavours\\. Achievement Points lost through failed Endeavours can be made up through random encounters and the pursuit of side adventures\\. These points reflect the Explorers adapting to the fluid nature of life in the stars and new doors opening when others close\\. \n\n- As with Common Endeavours, it's very likely that the Explorers have amassed more Achievement Points than needed to complete their Meta Endeavour\\. These surplus points can now be converted into Profit Factor at the rate of \\+1 point of Profit Factor for every 100 excess Achievement Points\\. To say that Meta Endeavours are extremely profitable is a gross understatement\\. \n- Epic Meta Endeavours are resolved slightly differently than Monumental and Legendary Endeavours, as they are largely their own reward\\. Achievement Points are tallied normally, and the ability to make up for failed Common Endeavours is still present\\. In this case however, excess Achievement Points cannot be converted into Profit Factor\\. Since Epic Endeavours are typically full campaigns, by the climax the Explorers should either be wealthy beyond their wildest dreams, extremely powerful and influential in the highest levels of the Imperium, or perhaps dead, corrupted or even worse\\. Once the Epic Endeavour is completed, the campaign is, for all intents and purposes, over and it's time to make new characters and seek new adventures elsewhere in the Imperium\\.\n","excerpt":"# Meta Endeavours   Meta Endeavours are campaign\\-level Endeavours in which the Explorers take an active role\\.

The mere knowledge that such things exist is deathly terrifying to the average citizen of the Imperium\\. In the course of their investigations, Acolytes come face\\-to\\-face with horrific creatures and experience terrifying events, from bloody mass sacrifices in the name of dark gods to impossible xenos monstrosities from the darkest void\\. Overcoming their fear in order to fight on against such terrors can be amongst the greatest challenges Acolytes must face\\. When a PC is confronted by such a frightening event or adversary, he must make a Fear test; this is a Willpower test, which is modified by how frightening the horror he faces is\\. If the PC passes this test, then he continues to act as normal\\. If he fails, however, he succumbs to Fear\\.\n\n## Degrees of Fear\n\nFear can come in many forms, but some things are clearly more frightening than others\\. A horrid cult sacrifice could break the morale of a novice Acolyte, while a Bloodthirster's appearance might completely destroy his mind\\. See the Fear Trait for more information\n\n### Very Bad Things\n\nFear tests in non\\-combat situations are very much the GM's call as to when and where they occur, and should not be considered automatic\\. They can be best used to bring home the horrific nature of a scene\\. The following are some guidelines for setting degrees of Fear outside of combat, and examples of situations that would cause a Fear test other than those triggered by an enemy's Fear trait:\n\n- __Fear \\(1\\) Disturbing__: Viewing the scene of a gruesome murder, or seeing minor unknown supernatural or psychic phenomena—strange lights, spectral voices, weeping statues, and other unnatural occurrences\\.\n- __Fear \\(2\\) Frightening__: Meeting someone known to be dead, being buried alive, or encountering major supernatural phenomena—the skies raining blood, paintings coming to life, or flesh bursting into flame\\.\n- __Fear \\(3\\) Horrifying__: Sudden, shocking, and inexplicable death \\(maggot swarms exploding out of a fellow Acolyte\\), hideous moments of revelation \\(awakening covered in blood, surrounded by torn open bodies\\), the dead rising across a whole planet, or other mind wrenching events\\.\n- __Fear \\(4\\) Terrifying__: Experiencing a full\\-scale daemonic incursion, discovering a personal failure is responsible for the wasted deaths of untold millions or an entire planet, staring unprotected into the Warp\\.\n\n## Failing the Fear Test\n\nIf a character fails a Fear test in a combat situation, he must immediately roll on the Shock Table, adding \\+10 to the result for each degree of failure after the first\\. The effects listed are applied immediately to the character\\. At the GM's discretion, depending on the situation and the cause of the Fear, he may also assign Insanity points to characters who fail a Fear test\\. If the character fails a Fear test in a non\\-combat situation, he becomes unnerved and suffers a –10 penalty to any skill or test that requires concentration\\. This penalty lasts while the character remains in the vicinity of the source of his Fear \\(simply leaving and coming back again doesn't stop this\\)\\. Whenever a character fails a Fear test by 3 or more degrees of failure, he also gains 1d5 Insanity points\\. In special situations or settings, the Game Master should feel free to also apply alternate or other effects, such as levels of Fatigue\\.\n\n### Shock\n__Roll__|__Result__\n-------|--------\n01–20  |The character is badly startled. He can only take a single Half Action during his next turn, but afterward he acts normally.\n21–40  |Fear grips the character and he begins to shake and tremble. He suffers a –10 penalty on all tests for the rest of the encounter unless he can Snap Out of It (Willpower test in his next turn).\n41–60  |Reeling with shock, the character backs away from the source of his Fear. He cannot willingly approach the object of his Fear, but can otherwise act normally, with a –10 penalty on all tests until the end of the encounter.\n61–80  |The character is frozen by terror. He can take no actions until he can Snap Out of It (Willpower test in his next turn). After snapping out of it, he makes all tests with a –10 penalty for the rest of the encounter.\n81–100 |Panic grips the character. He must flee the source of his fear, if able, as fast as he can, and if prevented from doing so, can only take Half Actions and is at a –20 penalty to all tests. Once away from the danger, he must successfully Snap Out of It (Willpower test in his next turn) to regain control.\n101–120|Fainting dead away, the character keels over and remains Unconscious for 1d5 rounds. Once he regains consciousness, he is still shaken and takes all tests with a –10 penalty until the end of the encounter.\n121–130|Totally overcome, the character screams and vomits uncontrollably for 1d5 rounds. During this time he can do nothing, and drops anything he is holding. Afterward, until the end of the encounter, the character can only take a single Half Action each turn.\n131–140|The character laughs hysterically and randomly attacks anything near him in a manic frenzy, firing wildly or attacking with whatever he has at hand. This effect lasts until the character Snaps Out of It (Willpower test in his next turn), or until he is knocked Unconscious or otherwise incapacitated.\n141–160|The character crumples to the ground for 1d5+1 rounds and begins sobbing, babbling, and tearing at his own flesh, and can do nothing else. Even after he returns to his senses, he is a complete mess, and suffers a –20 penalty on all tests until the end of the encounter.\n161–170|The character's mind snaps. He becomes catatonic for 1d5 hours; for that time, he is Unconscious and cannot be roused.\n171+   |The character is so overcome with terror that his heart stops: he must make a Challenging (+0) Toughness test or die. If he succeeds, the character still falls Unconscious for 1d5 hours, and cannot be roused for that time.\n\n### Shock and Snapping Out of It\n\nCharacters can try to shake off some of the effects of Fear after the initial shock has worn off\\. When specified in a Shock result that a character can “snap out of it”, he makes a Willpower test in his next turn\\. If successful, he regains his senses, shrugs off the effects, and can act normally\\. If he fails, the effect continues and the character can try to snap out of it again in the following turn, and so on\\.\n","excerpt":"# Fear  The nightmarish galaxy of the 41st millennium is inimical to humanity, and Acolytes must battle against terrifying aliens, perversions of science, unholy entities from beyond the veil, and innumerable other horrors in the course of their duties\\.

Often a subtler approach is necessary, and any would-be Chaos Lord will need to spend time examining and learning these ways. Although Black crusade is centrally a game about the deeds and actions of Heretics as they advance along the fine path between endless infamy and total corruption, times will arise when those that serve the Chaos Gods must take a step back and search for answers hidden from lesser beings if they are to fully divine their fate. These following Investigation rules are designed to guide GMs in the creation of Investigations for their Black crusade games, adding additional depth to the endless intrigues and plots that surround all those who would Ascend.\n\n## Using An Investigation\n\nMany, though certainly not all, Investigations can be broken down into distinct parts:\n\n-   The introduction to the investigation.\n-   Finding and interpreting the evidence.\n-   Tracking down what is required (an adversary responsible or the information the heretics are seeking).\n-   Confronting the adversary or finding the information.\n-   Dealing with the aftermath.\n\n### The Introduction\n\nThe first step is to provide the Heretics with something to investigate. The Heretics' motives are also established at this time. Their motive might be the search for rivals who have been plaguing them for some time, perhaps looking for their base of operations or something very important to them that the Heretics could destroy or corrupt. The motive could be the search for more arcane knowledge, such as the True Name of a daemon, the methods required to perform a particular ritual, or the location of ancient and powerful artefacts. At other times, the Heretics may simply stumble upon, be directed to, or even forced by greater powers into a given Investigation-worthy scene or event, and the mystery can unfold from there.\n\nSetting The Scene\n\nOnce the introduction has been established, the GM will need to flesh out the three main details of the event that required the Heretics' intervention in the first place. These are:\n\n-   **The Adversary** This could be an individual or group who are directly attempting to destroy the Heretics, or steal or corrupt something belonging to the Heretics or their allies; or it might simply be someone who is between the Heretics and the information they seek.\n-   **The Mystery** This is the event that the Heretics are investigating. Maybe the Heretics have been left stranded on Q'Sal after their transport was sabotaged by an unknown cult, or maybe a grand Tzeentchian Sorcerer has vanished, leaving his extensive artefact collection unguarded and the Heretics must learn where this hidden sanctum truly lies so that they might pillage it for its secrets.\n-   **The Setting** The Investigation needs to be grounded within a specific place, such as the ash planes of Dread Korvaska or the Slave-Habs of the Hollows.\n\n### Clues And Evidence\n\nAt the heart of any good mystery lies a clue, that piece of evidence the Heretics can use to puzzle together what is happening (or has happened) that will propel the plot forward. In some cases, the initial clue will be handed to the Heretics by an ally. Other times, the Heretics will be forced to gather the evidence for themselves, carefully sifting through the information they have gathered. Evidence can be as abstract or concrete as the GM desires. It can be a mysterious vox communiqué that may never be deciphered but is still fought over, or the remnants of a failed ritual that spurs the Heretics to discover its secrets and powers.\n\n#### Multiple Pieces Of Evidence\n\nThe Heretics may uncover multiple pieces of evidence, and these could lead them to two or more separate destinations. This is a great way to split an Investigation and make it non-linear. The Heretics will have to choose the order on which they would like to follow the evidence, and under circumstances in which time is a factor, they may decide to split the group and send Heretics to cover multiple clues simultaneously.\n\n### Following Leads\n\nDuring this stage of the Investigation, the Heretics more fully uncover the plot. They begin to piece together the details of whatever originally necessitated the Investigation. Pacing and the appropriate establishment of dramatic tension are the most important elements of this section. Sometimes this stage of the Investigation will involve a chase, such as piloting a stolen lighter into orbit before a cell of rival cultists can escape with the location of the missing sorcerer's hidden sanctum, or catching a hated Inquisitorial agent who might have absconded with a grimoire that holds the partial True Name of a powerful Lord of Change. During this portion of the Investigation, the Heretics may also encounter all manner of complications. Their adversary may discover that he is being followed and may start covering his trail and eliminating anyone who could help the Heretics pursue him further. If the Investigation has stalled, the GM may consider providing the Heretics with a break in the case in order to get things back on track, such as a cultist barely clinging to life after a failed attempt to summon a herald of Slaanesh, or perhaps an enemy of the missing sorcerer who promises to help the Heretics find the hidden sanctum if she gets a share in the spoils. During this portion of the Investigation, the GM can also provide the Heretics with plot-specific events as a way of further explaining story elements that pertain to the Investigation at hand.\n\n### The Showdown\n\nOnce the Heretics have uncovered or cornered their adversaries, the showdown can begin. This section usually relies on the combat rules, though a proper Investigation into the weakness of a particularly powerful foe is often crucial to its defeat. There are numerous types of adversaries to choose from and this is also an opportunity to set a memorable scene in which the environment is just as much an obstacle in the Heretics' path as their foe.\n\n### The Resolution\n\nThis is the point when the Heretics discover how successful they were at finding the information they desire, or destroying the agents who have been working against them. It is at this stage that the immediate consequences of their actions are made known and sometimes their adversary may escape, either as a part of the plot or as a result of the actions of the Heretics. If the Heretics were successful, they can be rewarded with new resources and equipment, or perhaps even gain Infamy within the Vortex. If their Investigation was a failure, they can be punished or abandoned by those they would call allies, losing Infamy or even gaining Corruption. Here the Heretics can be rewarded for quick thinking (or penalised for the opposite). The GM can foreshadow future threats and other consequences at this point.\n\n### Working Backwards\n\nWhen building an Investigation adventure, it can be quite helpful if the GM works backwards from his intended goal. Rather than determining what the Heretics will be uncovering, and then who is behind the crime, the GM can craft a compelling villain or obstacle and decide why the Heretics would get involved. Armed with a fleshed out adversary, the GM is free to craft a more realistic storyline. The GM can determine an appropriate showdown and creative minions in the process. Working backwards from the adversary also gives the GM a better grasp of the adversary's proper motivations. An understanding of what motivates him and why he would stand in the Heretics' way can be used as a potential break in the case, or additional clues when the pacing starts to slow down. The GM can do this without an adversary, using an exciting showdown location, a creative idea for a chase, or even just a brutal crime scene as a starting point for the creation of the mystery. By working from the middle, the GM can also break the formula. Creatively dodging or baffling player expectations can provide an enjoyable evening of gaming if done correctly. This can be tricky, however, as the Heretics might feel like failure was a forgone conclusion in some Investigations, though if properly played out can be just as satisfying as a stellar victory.\n\n## Elements Of An Investigation\n\nAn Investigation is often a smaller part of a larger adventure, but if the Investigation is the main adventure in and of itself, there are a few key details the GM should determine in advance. Investigations that represent a whole story-- beginning, middle, and end-are in need of four elements: an\n\nintroduction, an adversary for the Heretics to pursue, a clearer description of the mystery the Heretics are unravelling, and a setting in which to do their investigating.\n\n### The Introduction\n\nThis portion of the Investigation is designed to provide the Heretics with the motivation for starting the Investigation and seeing it through. It provides a crucial hook and sets the tone for the rest of the Investigation. There are numerous other ways for a GM to begin an Investigation; perhaps one of the Heretics learns a partial ritual of Daemonhood from a sorcerer-lord he had met before, or receives a communiqué from himself warning of a future event!\n\n### The Adversary\n\nAt this point, the GM may wish to begin to characterise the main adversary of whatever event necessitated the Investigation. This allows the GM to further plan out the theme of his Investigation and can affect the type of adversaries he plans on using. Trying to learn the True Name of a greater daemon might lead to a different kind of atmosphere than uncovering the identities of undercover Inquisitorial agents. Part of this process is figuring out what motivates the adversary. The end goal of the adversary can be as simple or as complicated as the GM likes, but it will usually factor heavily into the nature of the mission. This is especially important when setting up what the success and failure conditions are and what the Heretics need to do to achieve or avoid them. Chapter XI: Adversaries of the Black crusade Core Rulebook is a good source for sample adversaries, ranging from vengeful greater daemons to mysterious Harlequin Shadowseers.\n\n### The Mystery\n\nOnce the GM has a good adversary, it is time to tie him to a particular plot. The Heretics need to know or possess the capacity to find out how their adversary is connected to the mystery, perhaps via a piece of evidence tied directly to the adversary's origins, or something left behind at a failed ritual. Perhaps the Heretics are helping the rulers of the Velklir track an assassin, or they may be trying to locate an escaped slave that knows the location of a hidden artefact sanctum. Sometimes an Investigation's piece of Evidence (see page 71 for further details) flows naturally from the mystery at hand, and other times establishing the clue can provide the spark that eventually leads to a fully fleshed out Investigation.\n\n### The Setting\n\nThe Heretics now have a reason to start their Investigation, and the GM likely has an idea of what it is they may find once they get there, but the Investigation still needs a setting. The setting should have a sense of character all its own. The Screaming Vortex contains an untold number of worlds, and all are influenced by the warp and the Ruinous Powers in some way. This means that any type of terrain or combination of landscapes is possible. Even time itself is inconsistent within the warp, so a setting could encompass present, past and future events. As a final touch, the GM may wish to pre-plan how the Heretics will reach their destination or, if the GM feels so inclined, he may let the Heretics take care of the logistics themselves.\n\n## Investigation Events\n\nInvestigation Events are a formal way of handling the Heretics' interactions with others while gathering, examining, and analysing information as part of a goal. These rules primarily offer a framework for GMs to use in preparation for an Investigation- heavy Black crusade game and secondarily offer Heretics extended options when using their investigation skills.\n\n### In The Beginning...\n\nEstablishing where the Heretics find their first major clue is an easy way to set the theme for the rest of the Investigation. Will the Heretics be stealthily searching a heavily patrolled library of closely-guarded secrets or will they be searching a series of slave pits looking for information? Will they be scrutinising a crime scene in the depths of a hive or will they be plunging into trackless wastes in pursuit of their prey?\n\nTo find a physical clue, or to find any other details necessary to start their Investigation, the Heretics will usually have to pass an Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test, modified by both the sort of environment they are searching in and the skill of the adversary and what lengths he went to in order to hide his tracks (see Table: Search Modifiers).\n\n#### Search Modifiers                               \n  \n**Environmental Factors**                             \n\n| Roll | Scene | Modifier | Examples | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| 01-25 | Pristine | +10 | Arcane Library | \n| 26-50 | Clean | +0 | Hab-Units | \n| 51-75 | Cluttered | --10 | Hive City Streets | \n| 76-00 | Total Mess | --20 | Crumbling Underhive\n\n**Adversary's Skill**\n\n| Roll | Scene | Modifier | Examples | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| 01-25 | Careless | +10 | Crime of Passion;Khornate Ritual Massacre | \n| 26-50 | Careful | +0 | Paranoid sorcerer;professional criminal | \n| 51-75 | Expert | --10 | Trained assassin;Inquisitorial agent | \n| 76-00 | Highly Trained | --20 | Officio Assassinorum operative;Eldar Warlock | \n\n#### Miscellaneous Modifiers\n\nThe Awareness Test to pick through a given scene can be further modified by the Heretics' equipment, resources, and thoroughness, at the GM's discretion.\n\n### The Evidence\n\nAt the heart of any Investigation is a crucial piece of evidence, the clue from which the Heretics must extrapolate the details of the event that they are investigating (be it something they wish to find or learn, or someone they need to stop, help or locate). The GM may pick out a piece of evidence that suits a plot that he already has in mind, or he may start with a clue and use it as his inspiration for fashioning an Investigation story. For the purposes of an Investigation, the clue is broadly used to describe anything the Heretics may come across that will propel the Investigation forward.\n\n#### Linked Skills\n\nA Linked Skill is a Skill that is tied to a particular piece of evidence or clue and is used to investigate that particular item. An ancient star chart would be investigated via the Scholastic Lore (Astromancy) Skill, whereas Forbidden Lore (Inquisition) might allow the Heretics to find out the identity of an Inquisitorial agent in their midst. Linked Skills serve as an easy way to come up with a theme for an Investigation. When a given piece of evidence has an appropriate Linked Skill or two, Heretics who possess those skills will have a much easier time with the Investigation. Using a Linked Skill allows the GM to gauge how difficult a given Investigation will be for a group. Linked Skills also make brainstorming plot ideas for the Investigation much easier, and the GM should always establish which Skills would be considered \"linked\" to each clue or piece of evidence.\n\n### Investigation Skill Test\n\nEach Investigation has an associated Investigation Skill Test. The Investigation Skill Test uses the Linked Skill associated with whatever clue or piece of evidence lies at the heart of the Investigation. The Difficulty of the Investigation Skill Test depends on the Investigation's Complexity. Complexity also determines the Base Time the Investigation will take to complete. The GM should choose from or roll on Table: Investigation Benchmarks to determine what the Complexity and Base Time will be for his Investigation. A success on the Investigation Skill Test allows the Heretic to roll 1d10 and add the appropriate Characteristic Bonus (as determined by the Characteristic Bonus used for the Test). This value in hours is added to the time considered successfully spent on the Investigation. For every Degree of Success after the first, he may roll another 1d10 and subtract this value in hours from the Base Time the Investigation is projected to take. This represents the Heretics skillfully making leaps of logic and drawing on past experience in order to solve the mystery. Once the Heretics have progressed the Investigation by a preset amount of time, the GM may trigger a Plot Point.\n\n#### Investigation Benchmarks\n| Roll | Complexity | Difficulty | Examples | Base Time | \n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | \n| 01-10 | Simple | Easy | Discovering marketplace gossip; finding out who runs the local slave guild. | 1 hour\n| 11-25 | Basic | Routine | Learning the alignment of a powerful champion; discovering the general history of an area. | 6 hours\n| 26-40 | Drudging | Ordinary | Discovering the more prominent cults in an area. | 24 hours\n| 41-60 | Taxing | Challenging | Identifying an obscure poison; finding the identity of underground artefact traders. | 72 hours\n| 61-75 | Laborious | Difficult | Learning the history of a daemon entity; rediscovering something the Inquisition covered up. | 14 days\n| 76-90 | Involved | Hard | Translating an entire tome of ancient rituals; discovering a True Name of a daemon. | 1 month\n| 91-00 | Labyrinthine | Very Hard | Learning the full True Name of a powerful greater daemon; learning how to construct a daemon engine; infiltrating an enemy cult and usurping their leadership. | 1d5 years\n\nA failure on the Investigation Test indicates that no progress has been made. Failing an Investigation Test by three or more Degrees of Failure indicates that the Investigation has suffered a serious setback. The GM should add 1d10 hours to the Base Time required to complete the Investigation and may trigger a Complication (see below). Failing by five or more Degrees indicates that the Investigation has ground to a complete halt. The GM may either declare the Investigation a failure, or trigger a Break in the Case (see below) to allow the Heretics to get the Investigation back on track. The GM may alternatively decide to trigger a Complication, Break in the Case, or Plot Point at any time he deems it narratively appropriate to do so and, for Investigations of Arduous or greater Complexity, the GM can reduce or increase the Total Time or Base Time (based on the results of an Investigation Skill Test) by percentage increments instead of hours.\n\n#### Assisting an Investigation\n\nAn Investigation Skill Test can benefit from Assistance. Each assisting ally reduces the difficulty of the Investigation Skill Test by one step. Each assisting ally must have a Linked Skill appropriate to the piece of information being investigated and no more than two allies can assist on a single Test. Assistance does not affect the Base Time of an Investigation Skill Test. Sometimes Heretics will have ideas about how to further an Investigation that are beyond the scope of a Skill Test. If a Heretic takes a particular action that the GM deems helpful to the Investigation, even if it is not particularly Skill-related, the GM can reduce the difficulty of the Investigation Skill Test or, in the case of a successful Investigation Skill Test, award the Investigation a number of Degrees of Successes based on how helpful the Heretic's actions were. If a Heretic has taken an action that the GM decides will ultimately be harmful to the Investigation, the GM can increase the difficulty of the Investigation Skill Test, or penalise a failed Investigation Skill Test with extra Degrees of Failure.\n\n#### The Next Step\n\nOnce the time spent equals the Investigation's Base Time, the Investigation is a success. The Heretics receive the information they are looking for and may continue on to whatever the GM has planned for them.\n\n### Complications, Breaks, And Plot Points\n\nEach Investigation has additional events that can be triggered at various points. Complications occur when the Heretics accrue too many Degrees of Failure or hit specific triggers. Breaks in the Case occur when the Investigation completely stalls out and the GM wants to give the Heretics a second chance instead of declaring the Investigation a failure. Plot Points occur as a way for the GM to further the narrative and add additional flavour to the adventure.\n\n#### Complications\n\nComplications are challenges that occur during the Investigation. A Complication usually manifests as an in-game problem that needs to be either role played or fought through. Complications can include false leads throwing the Heretics off the right path, vital evidence being stolen, their disguises revealed, enemy factions attempting to stop the Investigation by force, or agents of a higher authority getting in the way. The possibilities are endless and the GM should always try to come up with a unique complication for the Heretics to face. The GM should provide a bonus to the next Investigation Skill Test the Heretics take if they resolve the Complication successfully.\n\n#### Breaks in the Case\n\nFailing the Investigation Test by five or more Degrees of Failure means that the Investigation has ground to a halt. The GM can allow the Heretics to fail the Investigation, or he can use a Break in the Case to get the Investigation moving again. This could come in the form of an anonymous tip pointing the Heretics back in the right direction, or perhaps a rival of their adversary offering some extra advice, or even another event taking place similar to the event that started the entire Investigation in the first place (such as the same failed ritual being attempted again). Each Break in the Case represents an opportunity that the Heretics can use to find new and different avenues for their Investigation. It may involve bringing to light information about the evidence they have already gathered or it may involve new evidence altogether.\n\n#### Plot Points\n\nPlot Points are challenges that the Heretics must overcome that tie into the main story or that reveal a critical part of the plot. Plot Points can be generic, but they are often tied to a given piece of evidence's Linked Skill. Plot Points can range from basic combat where the Heretics need to fight their way out of trouble, to a new discovery that reveals something more about their adversary, to a twist that throws them in a new direction or changes the way they viewed a previous piece of evidence, or even more details about the overall narrative within the Investigation. As with Complications and Breaks in the Case, the GM is encouraged to come up with new and interesting Plot Points to further the Investigation.\n\nPlot Points are storytelling elements first and foremost, so it is entirely appropriate to mix and match them. Because a given piece of evidence's Linked Skill is so often tied thematically to the plot of the ongoing Investigation, it is often a good idea to incorporate the theme of that Skill into the Investigation as one of the Plot Points (such as machinery and technology if the Linked Skill was based around Tech- Use, or warp travel and voidship technology if the Linked Skill was based around the Navigate (Warp) Skill).\n\n#### The Ticking Clock\\...\n\nThe GM can add tension by keeping strict track of time. Adding plot point events that are set to happen on a regular schedule and/or using a deadline to measure an Investigation's success or failure are both valid ways to keep an Investigation interesting.\n\n## Ending The Investigation\n\nThe final step is resolving the Investigation. The GM should look at how successful or unsuccessful the Heretics were in seeing the Investigation to its close and reward or penalise them as appropriate.\n\n### Success\n\nFirst and foremost, the most important result of a successful Investigation is that the Heretics get whatever piece of information they seek. Sometimes this will be the data that leads them directly to the next part of the adventure. Other times it will be important information to be used later. More rewards for the Heretics succeeding include equipment, experience, Infamy, contacts, and, where appropriate, Corruption. Generally speaking, a successful Investigation should see the Heretics rise above where they once were-- there is no altruism within the Vortex, so any Investigation will likely be conducted out of selfishness or self-preservation. GMs should reward ruthless Heretics who successfully complete Investigations, especially if they emerge from the Investigation more powerful than when they first started.\n\n### Failure\n\nThe GM should also have a few failure conditions written into the Investigation. This can be as simple as a certain cumulative amount of Degrees of Failure on the Investigation Skill Test, whether or not a certain Plot Point is botched by the Heretics, or even a hard time limit. Penalties for the Heretics failing can include the loss of an important NPC, demotion and a loss of Infamy, Corruption, the ire of a powerful daemon, the loss of Dark Patronage from the Dark Gods, or a host of other negative consequences. The Screaming Vortex is an unforgiving place, so GMs are encouraged to be quite unforgiving themselves.\n","excerpt":"# Investigation  The blessings of the Dark Gods do not simply come to those that ask for them, and not every conflict between the servants of Chaos can be resolved through death and destruction. Often a subtler approach is necessary, and any would-be Chaos Lord will need to spend time examining and learning these ways. Although Black crusade is centrally a game about the deeds and actions of Heretics as they advance along the fine path between endless infamy and total corruption, times will arise when those that serve the Chaos Gods must take a step back and search for answers hidden from lesser beings if they are to fully divine their fate. These following Investigation rules are designed to guide GMs in the creation of Investigations for their Black crusade games, adding additional depth to the endless intrigues and plots that surround all those who would Ascend."},{"srdPath":"navigators/houses","title":"Navigator Houses","content":"# Navigator Houses\n\n---\n\n## Nomadic Houses\t\n\nSome of the Great Houses have forsaken ties of sector and system, relinquishing their terrestrial holdings. Instead, over the centuries, these Navigator Houses have taken wholly to the stars to become wanderers and gypsies, their lines preserved on vast fleets of ships constantly on the move. To be part of a Nomadic House is to be born between the stars and spurn the life of a dirt dweller. It is also this long term exposure to both the void and the Immaterium that hones the skills of Navigators from Nomadic Houses, giving them an understanding of space and warp second to none. \n\nSome Nomadic Houses known to travel the Expanse include Term'L, Xan'Tai and Aleene.\n\nA Navigator character that belongs to a Nomadic House gains the following benefits:\n\n#### Lore of the Wanderer\nThe Navigator has an ingrained affinity with passage between distant and uncharted stars and gains the Talented (Navigation (Warp)) Talent. \n#### A Taste for the Warp\nLiving in constant contact with the veil between real space and the warp, the Navigator can read it like few others. The Navigator can spend a Fate Point to automatically succeed in using a Navigator power; if degrees of success are relevant to the effects of the power, he will succeed by 1d5 degrees of success with 5 counting as 0 degrees of success. \n#### Scorn of Dirt Dwellers\nThose that have roamed the void for so long feel uncomfortable in the cultures of dirt dwellers and usually cannot wait to return to space. Whenever the Navigator is on a planetary body and must deal with locals he suffers a –10 to all Fellowship tests and skills based on Fellowship. \n#### Initial Mutation\nNavigators from a Nomadic House begin play with a single Navigator Mutation rolled randomly from Table Navigator Mutations. They may develop additional mutations as normal when they acquire new Navigator Powers or increase their mastery of existing powers.\t\n\n---\n\n## Magisterial Houses\t\n\nGreatest in size and power are the Magisterial Houses. The roots of the original Navigator families, these Houses maintain mighty palaces on Terra and their influence reaches to the very edges of the light of the Astronomican. The Magisterial Houses maintain traditions and practices that have served them for millennia. They are masters of the traditional Navigator crafts and have more control over the malign mutations that afflict those with the gene. To be part of a Magisterial House is to know without question the purity of your blood and the ancient power and nobility of your family. \n\nMagisterial Houses with influence in the Expanse include the grand houses of Benetek and Vor'cle.\n\nA Navigator character that belongs to a Magisterial House gains the following benefits\n\n#### Warp Focus\nThe warp eye is the core of a Navigator's being and his oldest and most potent tool. Once per game session he may force a single opponent to re-roll a successful test when testing to resist the effects of The Lidless Stare Navigator Power. \n#### Resistant Genes\nThe Navigators of a Magisterial House are less likely to mutate due to their carefully cultivated genes. Whenever they must test for mutation the test is considered Routine (+20) rather than Ordinary (+10). \n#### Exalted Lineage\nThe blood of the most ancient and powerful navigator houses gifts their scions with a position of prestige amongst the nobility of the Imperium. The Navigator may call upon this lineage in social situations and gains a +10 bonus to any Interaction Skill Test when dealing with members of the Imperial nobility. \n#### Initial Mutation\nNavigators from a Magisterial House begin play with a single Navigator Mutation chosen from the following options: Strangely Jointed Limbs, Elongated Form, Pale and Hairless Flesh, Eyes as Dark as the Void. They may develop additional mutations as normal when they acquire new Navigator Powers or increase their mastery of existing powers.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n---\n\n## Shrouded Houses\n\nShrouded houses have suffered great losses or shame within the more established dominions of the Imperium. They have opted to move their powerbase completely to the edge of known space, where they cling to the barest strands of their former status and power. Though they may be rich in skill, knowledge or lore, something in the past of Shrouded Houses has blighted them and reduced them to a state so far from their once exalted position that they are sometimes cruelly called ‘beggar houses' by their more successful counterparts. To be part of a Shrouded House is to be part of a fallen line that is slowly rising again to stand defiant against those that once cast them down—or at least, so you are told by your elders. Their loss in standing has often forced such houses to flee to the margins of the Imperium and to develop a cunning and opportunistic mindset alongside a skill that is often lacked by more comfortably indolent houses.\n\nSome of the more powerful and influential include the Modar, Yeshar, and the Rey'a'Nor triumvirate as well as the notorious Cedd house.\n\nA Navigator character that belongs to a Shrouded House gains the following benefits:\n\n#### Destitute\nThe navigator's fortunes are so low that he has little or nothing and is initially a drain on the resources of his fellows. The presence of a navigator from a Shrouded Lineage reduces the group's starting Profit Factor, or their individual Influence, by –1. \n#### A Gaze to Pierce the Soul\nThe Navigator has a keen understanding of a person's relationship to the warp born of enforced self-reliance and bitter musings. The Navigator begins play with Gaze into the Abyss as a bonus power. In addition, he may raise this ability above Master to Paragon (the xp cost is the same as to raise to Master) giving him a +30 bonus on all tests with this power. \n#### Mercantile Opportunists\nRaised in a volatile atmosphere where the need for profit and advancement outweighed all other concerns, these Navigators have had to learn the hard way the skills of hard bargaining and contract hunting—needs most of their kind are normally sheltered from. The Navigator gains a +10 bonus to tests with the Commerce and Charm Skills. \n#### Initial Mutation\nNavigators from a Shrouded House begin play with a single Navigator Mutation rolled randomly from Table Navigator Mutations. They may develop additional mutations as normal when they acquire new Navigator Powers or increase their mastery of existing powers.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n---\n\n## Renegade Houses\n\nSome of the Great Houses have completely forsaken the traditions and ancient practices of the Navigator families in their quest for power, or may have been turned on by the rest of the Navis Nobilite, harrowed, and driven into exile. Dabbling heavily in the genes of their children in order to improve their lot, their tampering often leads to hideous mutations and unconscionable monsters in their lineage, which in turn leads to rejection by the Paternova and a hunt to extinction by the Inquisition. In some cases, however, it has birthed new strains of the gene and given rise to families with unique abilities and potent powers. To be a part of a Renegade House is to have cast aside the sacred Navigator traditions as small minded and restrictive and instead embraced the glory and limitless potential of your ancestry—or so the houses believe, to comfort themselves.\n\nIt is whispered that the Expanse is home to several Renegade Houses like the secretive Gazmati and the infamous Nostromo.\n\nA Navigator character that belongs to a Renegade House gains the following benefits:\n\n#### The Fruits of Corrupted Blood\nIn tampering with the fundamental nature of their bloodlines the Renegade Houses have created both monsters and marvels. The Navigator begins play with an additional Navigator Power. Additionally, the Navigator may also choose three Navigator Powers; these may include powers he does not yet have, but plans to later acquire. He gains a +10 bonus to all tests with these powers (in addition to bonuses for being an Adept or Master). In addition, all tests by others to resist these powers suffer a –10 penalty. \n#### Unchecked Mutation\nThe Navigator is more prone to mutation and mental instability that any others of his kind, representing the tampering of his family line and a life overshadowed by doom. When taking tests for mutation for gaining a new power or increasing an existing one, his tests are Challenging (+0) rather than Ordinary (+10) and he begins play with 1d5 Insanity points. \n#### Renegades\nThe price of dabbling in the unknown is high, and it has cost the Renegade Houses in both security and status. Navigators from Renegade Houses begin play with 1d5 Corruption points and the watchful eye of the Inquisition ever waiting to uncover wrongdoing. Also, all tests that involve interacting with the official bodies of the Imperium are at a –10 penalty. \n#### Initial Mutation\nNavigators from a Renegade House begin play with two Navigator Mutations rolled randomly from Navigator Mutations. They may develop additional mutations as normal when they acquire new Navigator Powers or increase their mastery of existing powers.\t\t\t\t\t\n\n---\n","excerpt":"# Navigator Houses  ---"},{"srdPath":"navigators/mutations","title":"Navigator Mutations","content":"# Navigator Mutations\n\n| Roll 1d100 | Mutation  | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| 01-15 | Strangely Jointed Limbs | Your limbs have extra joints that articulate differently to a normal human.

In a Rogue Trader's time, even the least of the dynasties will touch dozens of worlds and shape the fate of their civilizations, transforming the lives of millions and altering the fortunes of entire star systems\\. Even in a galactic empire that sprawls across tens of thousands of light years, a Rogue Trader has power that only a handful of humanity can imagine\\.\n\nTo represent this mighty wealth and influence, the Rogue Trader game uses Profit Factor\\. This value, more than anything else, is a measure of the Explorers' rising or failing fortunes\\. As the PCs' Profit Factor grows so to will their access to rare and powerful items, unique retainers, and exclusive organisations\\. Beyond personal power, Profit Factor also maps the rise of the Explorers' dynasty and over time will allow them to acquire legions of elite warriors, sprawling solar settlements, and even the favour of Imperial Adeptus\\. Table Profit and Power provides an example of Profit Factor and corresponding power within the Imperium\\.\n\nProfit Factor does not, however, represent any one thing, but rather is a combination of all the aspects of wealth and power at the Explorers' command\\. This means that Profit Factor is all at once the amount of coins in their coffers, their standing in Imperial society, and their complex web of loans, favours, and debts\\. As such, Profit Factor is used whenever the Rogue Trader wishes to exert the power of his dynasty or expand his dominion within the Imperium\\. In this section, we will cover the two most common uses of Profit Factor— Acquisition and Influence\n\n#### Acquisition\n\nProfit Factor is used by the Explorers to determine which equipment, resources, and rights they may acquire and maintain\\.\n\n#### Influence\n\nProfit Factor can also be used by the Explorers to influence Imperial society, call in favours, and enforce loyalty among their followers\\.\n\n### Profit and Power\n__Profit Factor__|__Examples__\n---|---\n5|Hive Gang, Outcast Sect\n10|Common Labour Guild, Struggling Merchant House\n15|Manufactory Combine, Weak Hive Guild\n20|Minor Ministorum Sect, Hab Collective\n25|Hive Guild, Merchant House, Disgraced Subsector Noble House\n30|Powerful Hive Guild, Impoverished Noble, Outcast Rogue Trader\n40|Planetary Noble, Planetary Merchant House, Lesser Rogue Trader, Weak Imperial Governor\n50|Greater Planetary Noble of a Wealthy World, Lesser Inquisitor, Cartel of Free Traders\n70|Wealthy Rogue Trader\n90|The Machenko Dynasty, Scion of a Great House of the Calixis Sector\n100|Legendary Rogue Trader, Lesser Navis Nobilite House, Potentate of the Navis Nobilite\n120|Great Houses of the Calixis Sector, Lord Inquisitor\n130|Great House Krin, Illustrious Navis Nobilite House, Lord\\-Sector Hax, High Archmagi of the Lathes\n150\\+|The Mightiest of Imperial Organisations and Rulers\n\n## Profit Factor vs Influence\n\nProfit Factor represents the wealth and power of an organization, not an individual's reputation or influence\\. To represent this, parties using Profit Factor may use it in place of their own Influence when invoking that organisation. Doing so allows easier access to many things, but failure and faux pas reflect on the entire group instead of just the individual\\. An individual may always use their personal Influence instead, and Profit Factor may not be substituted for Influence for purposes of Talent prerequisites.\n\nThe vast power of a Rogue Trader organization means that the economics of scale apply to their Acquisition checks\\. In addition to any other modifiers, apply the Scale modifier appropriate for the amount of goods being sought\\. Exceptions to this rule include Unique and Near Unique items, as well as Starship Components\\.\n\n| Scale | Modifier | Example  |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Negligible** | +30 | Single Man  |\n| **Trivial** | +20 | Squad (3–5)  |\n| **Minor** | +10 | Platoon (10–30)  |\n| **Standard** | +0 | Company (50–100)  |\n| **Major** | –10 | Regiment (500–1,000)  |\n| **Significant** | –20 | Division (2,000–5,000)  |\n| **Vast** | –30 | Army (10,000+) |\n\n\n## Starting Profit Factor\n\nA new Rogue Trader group begins play with a Profit Factor equal to the amount generated using Table Starting Profit Factor and Ship Points plus any additional the modifiers obtained during character creation\\. This amount generally places the group on a level with a planetary noble house, a free trader cartel, or a minor multi\\-world Ministorum sect\\.\n\n### Starting Profit Factor and Ship Points\n\n__Roll \\(1D10\\)__|__Profit Factor__|__Ship Points__|__Example__\n---|---|---|---\n1|60|30|Although the dynasty does not command a powerful starship, it possesses great resources\\.\n2–3|50|40|A good ship and a wealthy purse promise great things for this dynasty\\.\n4–7|40|50|The Rogue Trader dynasty is a fresh, new player on the galactic stage, garnering attention both fair and foul\\.\n8–9|30|60|A dynasty whose power is on the wane, but may yet recover\\.\n10|20|70|The Rogue Trader dynasty was once a great and powerful flame, now only a glimmer of its former glory\\.\n\n## Gaining and Losing Profit Factor\n\nProfit Factor rises and falls as a result of the actions of the Explorers\\. There are three things that affect Profit Factor: Awards, Endeavours, and Misfortunes\\.\n\n### Awards\n\nThese are a bonus that the GM gives the Explorers as a reward for their actions during play—in much the same way as Experience Points\\. Awards only ever raise the Explorers' Profit Factor by a single point\\.\n\n### Endeavours\n\nUnlike Awards, Endeavours are major undertakings by the PCs, involving such tasks as settling worlds, mining star systems, and charting warp routes\\. Endeavours are the main way in which Profit Factor is increased, and completing a substantial Endeavour can significantly raise the group's score\\.\n\n### Misfortunes\n\nProfit Factor is not normally expended when it is used—it represents wealth and power far too great to be dented by the purchase of simple equipment or by commanding the favour of local merchants\\. It can, however, be reduced by Misfortunes\\. These are events that inevitably befall the Explorers through the course of their adventures and enterprises and need to be countered by Awards and Endeavours or dealt with as required\\.\n\n##### Misfortunes Chance\n\n| d100        | Result | Profit Factor Lost |\n|---|---|---|\n| 01-49       | Fate smiles upon the Rogue Trader: no Misfortune | — |\n| 50-65       | Nuisance Misfortune | 1 |\n| 66-90       | Grim Misfortune | 2 |\n| 90-00       | Calamitous Misfortune | 1d5 |\n\n#### Random Misfortunes\n\n1d100 |Misfortune Details\n------|-------------------------\n01–05 |Administratum tithe clerks files for an assessment, empowered by their superiors to bleed the Rogue Trader a little more in the name of the God-Emperor.\n06–10 |Departmento Munitorum officers have come into evidence that the Rogue Trader has siphoned materiel from their Port Wander vaults, and are pressing upon him with the full force of Imperial law. The evidence is all false, of course, but what motivation is behind this outrage?\n11–15 |A setback in the tending of coffers: ledgers are errant and Thrones are lost. Is this a careless accident or hidden embezzlement?\n16–20 |A dire plague is abroad, and the merest threat of it is enough for quarantines and panic. Even places unaffected by the plague are disrupted by the havoc it wreaks many worlds away.\n21–25 |An accident fells many skilled hirelings, leaving too few possessing a rare talent in a vital position. Is it really an accident, however?\n26–30 |A corruption takes hold in one of the Rogue Trader's interests: cultists of the Dark Gods, a wayward Imperial Cult, or an unruly Crew Brotherhood act to sow toil and make trouble.\n31–35 |Zealots amongst the Rogue Trader's interests are stirring up the workers to make pilgrimage to the shrine worlds of the Drusus Marches. Toil is slackening, and servants are slipping away or rising up to petition the Rogue Trader to grant them leave to be pilgrims.\n36–40 |An ambitious Magos demands a new compact of tech-ritual and prayer, one much more favourable to Machine Cult coffers.\n41–45 |A Grand Assemblage of the Omnissiah's Grace is called by an Archmagos, and all Tech-Adepts pledged to the Rogue Trader are much withdrawn, the Machine Cult distant from what its Magi perceive as trivial responsibilities towards compacts and Imperial brethren.\n46–50 |The sub-sector trade market enters one of its doleful periods of crisis, loss, and hand-wringing. Merchant houses suffer and cut short their endeavours.\n51–55 |A new dictate of mercantile law has come to the Drusus Marches from Scintilla, and the upheaval that attends it is dire indeed. Many important guilders are ruined or driven to other lines of commerce, and many compacts are now worthless.\n56–60 |Pirates from Iniquity, thought broken and scattered, strike at the Rogue Trader's interests, assaulting vessels and raiding resource worlds.\n61–65 |The vile Ork emerges to loot and destroy the Rogue Trader's interests in the Koronus Expanse.\n66–70 |Calixian leaders of a great Imperial organisation suddenly display far less respect for Rogue Traders. This change of opinion will spread from the top down and out into the broader Imperial class if not stopped.\n71–75 |The Rogue Trader is supposed by some to be an adherent of one of the unseemly Imperial cults of Footfall, placing him well on the outside of civilised Imperial society in Port Wander and the Drusus Marches.\n76–80 |An influential noble or powerful Imperial hierarch chooses to denigrate the Rogue Trader, and all the sycophants follow that lead. This disrespect will spread from the top down into the broader Imperial class if not stopped.\n81–85 |The Rogue Trader is rumoured to have died. Administratum adepts now move slowly and inexorably towards the legal annulment of his Warrant of Trade.\n86–90 |Adeptus Arbites find, or are provided with, evidence of rebellion fomented amongst the Rogue Trader's hirelings. A lord perceived to hold an unruly estate will suffer in the eyes of his peers.\n91–95 |A rival's hatred for the Rogue Trader becomes well known, and many lesser figures prefer not to become involved with either side whilst such an enmity exists. Now, the rival has begun to strike openly against the Rogue Trader's interests.\n96–100|The Rogue Trader receives an unexplained and unexpected visitation from highly ranked members of the Inquisition, an event guaranteed to harm his prospects when word gets out.\n\n#### Overcoming Misfortunes\n\nWhen a Misfortune occurs, the Explorers are faced with two choices: they can deal with it or ignore it. Ignoring a Misfortune means that the Profit Factor lost to it is permanent, and at the GM's discretion, there may be other consequences as well, as plagues are allowed to run rampant, charges are gathered against the Explorers, or worlds slowly fall into chaos. If the Explorers choose to deal with the Misfortune, then they must allocate time and resources to combating it—perhaps at the expense of current Endeavours or missions. It then falls to the GM to decide if they have acted both swiftly enough and decisively enough to overcome the Misfortune. If they have, then he should allow them to recover any Profit Factor lost to the Misfortune.\n\n## Influence Tests\n\nAn Influence Test is a way for the Explorers to use their Profit Factor to sway powerful organisations or gain favour from the wealthy and powerful of the Imperium\\. Naturally, the higher their Profit Factor the more likely people are to take notice of them\\. To make an Influence Test, the Explorers must make a contest of their Profit Factor versus the Profit Factor of the person or organisation they wish to influence\\. This contest is treated as an Opposed Test\\. The GM can modify this roll as usual\\. For every degree that the Explorers beat their opponent on this Opposed Test, the GM can grant them a \\+5 on all Interaction Skill Tests with the organisation or person for the remainder of their immediate dealings \\(the bonus lasts until the end of the current encounter or even longer at the GM's discretion\\)\\. For every degree their opponent beats them, however, a –5 penalty on Interaction Skill Tests is levied instead\\. Alternatively, the GM can use an Influence Test as a one off roll to try to convince the person or organisation to grant the Explorers a favour, free passage, or give them some important information\\.\n","excerpt":"# Profit Factor  A Rogue Trader's wealth and power are vast indeed, stretching across the stars themselves\\.

Characters can become psykers by taking the Psyker elite advance. This grants them the ability to purchase psychic powers with experience points, and gives them access to a new resource: psy rating. Over the course of their adventures, warbands can encounter other beings that manifest powers using Warp energies. In all cases, the GM and players should use the rules presented here to represent a psyker's deadly gifts.\n\n## Psy Ratings\n\nPsy rating (PR) is a raw measure of a psyker's power and his ability to draw power from the Warp. The higher a psyker's PR, the more powerful he will be. PR usually ranges from 1 (an untrained Imperial psyker or petty Warp-witch) to 10 (a monstrous Greater Daemon of Tzeentch or masterful Eldar Farseer), though in some extremely special cases it might go higher still. PR is used to determine the potency of all psychic powers, such as range, area effect, or damage. To have any access to psychic powers, a character must have a PR of at least 1.\n\n### Psy Rating Advances\n\nA starting psyker has a psy rating of 1. Unlike other characteristics, however, psy rating is increased by spending experience points in a similar manner to gaining talents. Increasing a character's psy rating represents that character unlocking additional psychic potential, and becoming more and more powerful. The farther along a psyker progresses, the harder it becomes for him to strain his limits and grow in power, however. To increase his psy rating, the Acolyte spends experience points equal to 200x the psy rating to which he wishes to advance. So, if a psyker with a psy rating of 2 wants to increase his psy rating to 3, he must pay 3 x 200 xp, a total of 600 experience points. An Acolyte can advance his psy rating multiple times. Each time this is done, his psy rating increases by 1, to a maximum of 10. Note that an increase in psy rating does not provide additional psychic powers, only more control over them.\n\n## Psychic Disciplines\n\nPsychic powers are divided into different disciplines, based on how they use the energies of the Warp. Each discipline corresponds to a tree that determines its availability to a character.\n\n## Using Psychic Powers\n\nWhen a psyker, such as Sanctioned Psyker, wishes to use a psychic power, he must first choose how much power he is pouring into the ability, and any other methods he is using to draw upon and focus the power of the Warp. Then he must make a Focus Power Test (typically, but not always, a Willpower Test, modified by the difficulty of the power and the character's effective Psy Rating), to see if it manifests. Finally, if the Test is successful, the power will take effect. Depending on how much energy the psyker used and what methods he used to bolster his efforts, there may be additional consequences. The step-by-step process for using a psychic power is described below:\n\n#### Choose the power level (Fettered, Unfettered or Push)\n\nThe power level at which the psyker uses his power (reflecting how deeply he is drawing from the Warp) influences the likelihood of the psyker successfully manifesting the power, and also determines whether there are any unwanted side effects such as Psychic Phenomena.\n\n#### Make a Focus Power Test\n\nIn most cases, this is a Willpower Test (though there are some exceptions), the difficulty of which depends on the power, and which is modified further based on the power level chosen. In some cases, determined by the specific power, the target may Oppose this Test.\n\n#### Apply the Effects\n\nDepending on the psyker's final Psy Rating (as determined by the power level he has chosen), the power will have variable effects, such as increased range, area of effect, or Damage. Depending on the factors described above, the power may also generate Psychic Phenomena or even Perils of the Warp.\n\n### Psychic Strength\n\nWhenever a psyker uses a power, he is drawing energy from the Warp and channelling it into physical effects. However, opening such a conduit to the Warp is always dangerous, and the psyker incurs a chance of causing disturbances in the Warp that have undesired side-effects. In extreme cases, these disturbances may even lead to the opening of an uncontrolled rift between reality and the Warp, with potentially fatal consequences. By minimising the amount of power he draws, a psyker can reduce or eliminate the chances of side-effects such as Psychic Phenomena or Perils of the Warp.\n\nAlternatively, he can draw deeper from the well of the Warp to boost his powers beyond his normal capabilities. Of course, such power always comes with greater risk of unleashing unintended effects or even summoning unwanted visitors from beyond. The precise effects of Psychic Phenomena vary based on the nature of the psyker: The Sanctioned Psykers of the Imperium, the Librarians of the Space Marines, and the traitorous Sorcerers of the Chaos Space Marines draw on less power but may use it more safely, while unsanctioned witches and mortal wyrds are subject to harsher effects, but can draw more deeply in return, and those who are not mortal (that is, those with the Daemonic Trait) remain largely unperturbed by such trivial fluctuations of the Warp, and suffer far less severe effects. These varying effects are described on Table Psychic Strength.\n\n| Class of Psyker | Fettered (Psy Rating/2) | Unfettered (Psy Rating) | Push (Psy Rating +1 to +3/+4/+5) | Sustaining Powers |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Bound: Sanctioned Psykers and Astropaths, Librarians, and Chaos Space Marines | Make a Focus Power Test, counting Psy Rating as half normal. No chance to manifest Psychic Phenomena. | If the psyker rolls doubles during a Focus Power Test, roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table. |  May add up to +3 to Psy Rating when Pushing. Roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table, adding +10 to the total. | +10 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena Table, decrease Psy Rating by 1 per power. |\n| Unbound: Wyrds, renegade psykers and mortal sorcerers | Make a Focus Power Test, counting Psy Rating as half normal. No chance to manifest Psychic Phenomena. | If the psyker rolls doubles during a Focus Power Test, roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table, adding +10 to the total. | May add up to +5 to Psy Rating. Roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table at +5 per +1 PR added, up to a maximum of +25. | +10 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena Table, decrease Psy Rating by 1 per power. |\n| Daemonic: psychic daemons, Daemonhosts, and daemon princes | May not use powers at the Fettered level. | If the psyker rolls doubles during a Focus Power Test, roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table, adding +10 to the total. The psyker is not affected by the result unless the result causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him may be. | May add up to +4 to Psy Rating. Roll on the Psychic Phenomena Table at +10 per +1 PR added, up to a maximum of +40. The psyker is not affected by the result unless the result causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him may be. | +10 to all rolls on the Psychic Phenomena Table, decrease Psy Rating by 1 per power. The psyker is not affected by the result unless the result causes Perils of the Warp, though those around him may be. |\n\n\nWhen a psyker uses a power, he has a choice of using it at one of three different levels:\n\n#### Fettered\n\nThe psyker holds back his full power and carefully channels energy from the Warp, hopefully using just enough to manifest the power but not enough to trigger unnatural or dangerous effects. When any psyker uses a power at the Fettered level, he must make a Focus Power Test (see below) to manifest the power. The limited power involved means that the psyker must halve his PR (rounding up) when determining the bonus applied to the Focus Power Test and any effects the power has. However, regardless of the results of the Focus Power Test, there is no risk of triggering Psychic Phenomena.\n\n#### Unfettered\n\nThe psyker puts the full weight of his ability into the power and embraces the raging powers of the Warp. When a Psyker uses a power at the Unfettered level, he must make a Focus Power Test (see below) to manifest the power. As he is using his full natural ability, he uses his full PR when determining the bonus applied to his Focus Power Test and any effects the power has. However, should he roll a double (that is, both the tens dice and the units dice come up with the same number), he will suffer from an unexpected surge in the Warp and must roll on Table Psychic Phenomena. Note that it is possible for a psyker to successfully pass his Focus Power Test (thus successfully activating the power) and still suffer Psychic Phenomena.\n\n#### Push\n\nThe psyker draws deeply and greedily from the Warp, and hurls as much power forth as he possibly can in an attempt to manifest truly wondrous and terrifying effects. When using a power at the Push level, he must make a Focus Power Test (see below) to manifest the power. As the psyker is drawing deeply and recklessly from the Warp, he may add +1 to +3 (or more depending on the type of the psyker; this is detailed on Table Psychic Strength) to his Psy Rating when determining the bonus applied to his Focus Power Test and any effects the power has. However, regardless of the Test's result, the psyker will automatically generate a significant disturbance in the Warp and must roll on Table Psychic Phenomena and modify the result depending on the psyker's nature as described in Table Psychic Strength. Additionally, Pushing a power is taxing—if a psyker using this level of power rolls a double on his Focus Power Tests, he suffers a level of Fatigue from the effort.\n\n### Focus Power Test\n\nAny use of a psychic power begins with a Focus Power Action, which requires a Focus Power Test to determine whether or not the power manifests successfully, and how potent its effects are. The amount of time this action takes is determined by the power being used, and may be a Free Action, Half Action, Full Action, or Reaction. In most cases, a Focus Power Test is a Willpower Test, modified by the difficulty of the power being used, and the Psy Rating of the psyker, which grants a +5 bonus to the Test for every point of Psy Rating the psyker uses for that power. If this Test is passed, the power has manifested, while failing the Test means that the power does not manifest and nothing happens, though the Action is still used regardless of whether the power takes effect. A result of 91 or higher always indicates failure, regardless of any other factors. In many cases, the number of Degrees of Success scored when passing the Focus Power Test determines some of the effects of the power—when this is the case, it will be noted in the power's description.\n\nMany powers also indicate an Opposed Test, especially when used against an unwilling foe. If the Focus Power Test is an Opposed Test, the psyker must successfully pass the Test and gain more Degrees of Success than at least one of his opponents to activate the power. Note that even if the psyker loses the Opposed Test and does not activate the power, he still can generate a disturbance in the Warp if using the power at Unfettered or Push level.\n\n#### Example\n\nChalse Bishopstead is a neophyte Sanctioned Psyker with a Willpower of 32 and a Psy Rating of 2. When using his psychic powers at the Push power level, Chalse's Focus Power Tests (before being modified by the power) that use Willpower will succeed on 47, 52, 57 or less (Willpower 32, + Psy Rating 3, 4, or 5 x 5).\n\n### Resolve Power Results\n\nAfter the psyker successfully manifests a psychic power, he triggers the effects specified in the psychic power description and, if Psychic Phenomena were manifested by the Focus Power test, rolls for the effects of the Psychic Phenomena.\n\n#### Range and Line of Sight\n\nUnless noted in its description, a psychic power that directly targets an individual or thing requires a psyker to have line of sight to (or otherwise be \"aware\" of) the target. The target must also be within the power's stated range, but there are no modifiers for range (Short, Point Blank, etc.).\n\n#### Cumulative Effects\n\nModifiers, characteristic increases, and other benefits generated by psychic powers do not stack with each other—only the highest applies. They do stack with non-psychic bonuses, such as those granted by specialised equipment and environmental conditions.\n\n#### Detecting Psychic Powers\n\nPsykers are especially attuned to the Warp around them, able to sense the currents and eddies caused by other psykers dipping into the flow of the Immaterium. When psychic powers are in effect nearby, a psyker can make a Psyniscience test in order to determine their source. Others can also attempt this but, lacking a psyker's abilities, are less likely to succeed.\n\n#### Psychic Phenomena\n\nWhen a psyker reaches into the Warp, there is always the chance of the Empyrean bleeding into reality. Sometimes this manifestation is unique to the psyker, but in general it is as unpredictable as the Warp itself. Some effects can include a drop in temperature, ghostly voices, feelings of unease, or nearby vegetation shrivelling and dying. In rare instances, even full-scale Warp breaches can occur.\n\nThe precise effects a vary based on the nature of the psyker: the Sanctioned Psykers of the Imperium, the Librarians of the Adeptus Astartes, and the traitorous Sorcerers of the Chaos Space Marines draw on less power but can use it more safely. Unsanctioned psykers and mortal wyrds are subject to harsher effects, but can draw more deeply in return. Those who are not mortal (that is, those with the Daemonic trait) remain largely unperturbed by such trivial fluctuations of the Warp, and suffer far less severe phenomena. These varying effects are described on Table Psychic Strength.\n\nIf the psyker rolled doubles (or if the power was pushed) during his Focus Power test, a phenomenon occurs and the psyker must roll Psychic Phenomena. Particularly high rolls on this table can result in the psyker having to also roll Perils of the Warp. A few powers, as noted in their descriptions, cause other effects upon the material world when they manifest.\n\n#### Resisting Enemy Psychic Powers\n\nIf they are attacked by enemy psychic powers, psykers have far better mental defences than \"normal\" people, using the power of the Warp to fight back. When making an Opposed Focus Power Test to resist a psychic attack, a psyker may select a power level (Fettered, Unfettered or Push), and add his resultant Psy Rating to the Willpower Test to resist the enemy power. However, if resisting at Unfettered or Push level and his roll is a double, this generates Psychic Phenomena, in just the same way as the attacker.\n\n#### Psy Ratings in Psychic Powers\n\nUnless specifically stated otherwise, all references to psy rating in a power (such as for range or damage) are based on the final, effective psy rating used when manifesting the power. This means that if the psyker manifests a power at a value beneath his base psy rating, a power that has effects based on psy rating is going to do less than if he pushes.\n\n#### Sustaining Psychic Powers\n\nSome psychic powers can be sustained for a prolonged period of time, as noted in their description. A psyker may sustain such powers without the need to make further Focus Power tests, taking only a small amount of effort to sustain a single power. However, attempting to maintain multiple powers at once becomes increasingly taxing, dividing the psyker's attention between several simultaneous effects and requiring ever greater amounts of concentration.\n\nAny power that can be sustained has a listed action which defines how much effort the power requires to sustain—for example, a power with a sustain requirement of Half Action requires a Half Action each turn to sustain its effects. If the psyker is only attempting to sustain a single power, this is enough to maintain the effects. Any power that does not have the required action spent to sustain it ends at the end of the psyker's turn.\n\nSustaining multiple powers is more difficult. Any character attempting to sustain two or more powers at once must spend the longest action from the sustain requirements of all the powers being sustained, and reduces the effective psy rating for each power by the number of powers being sustained. More perilous still, the amount of energy the psyker is attempting to wield becomes unstable, swiftly going out of control at the most minor slip of concentration. Should the psyker cause Psychic Phenomena while sustaining more than one power, he must add +10 to the result rolled on Psychic Phenomena for every power after the first he is sustaining.\n\nAt the GM's discretion, PCs and particularly important NPCs can attempt to break free from powers being sustained against them. After a duration determined by the GM, such a character can attempt the same Opposed test to resist the power again; if the character wins the Opposed test, he breaks free of the power.\n\n## Psychic Bolts\n\nA number of powers produce blasts or energy bolts that inflict harm in a manner not dissimilar to a weapon. These powers all follow the same basic rules. The psyker must nominate a single target within range and line of sight; if the Focus Power test is successful, then the target is hit. Use the Focus Power test as the attack test to determine the Hit Location. There are three further variations on this: Psychic Barrages, Psychic Storms, and Psychic Blasts. Psychic Bolts of all kinds can be dodged as if they were any other kind of ranged attack. A successful Dodge test is sufficient to avoid a normal Psychic Bolt. Dodging a Psychic Storm or Psychic Blast is resolved in the same way as dodging Auto-Fire or Area Effect attacks, respectively.\n\n### Psychic Barrage\n\nA Psychic Barrage is a cluster of bolts of energy, similar to a semi-automatic weapon. If the Focus Power test succeeds, then the psyker produces one Psychic Bolt for the initial degree of success, plus one for every two additional degrees of success. The number of hits scored in this manner cannot exceed the psyker's effective psy rating when using this power. The first hit must strike the initially chosen target, while any subsequent hits may strike either the initial target or any other targets within two metres, providing all of the targets are within range and line of sight.\n\n### Psychic Storm\n\nA Psychic Storm comprises many bolts of energy, similar to fully automatic weapon fire. If the Focus Power test succeeds, then the psyker produces a number of Psychic Bolts equal to the number of degrees of success. The number of hits scored in this manner cannot exceed the psyker's effective psy rating when using this power. The first hit must strike the initially chosen target, while any subsequent hits may strike either the initial target or any other targets within two metres, providing all of the targets are within range and line of sight.\n\n### Psychic Blast\n\nA Psychic Blast detonates to cover a wide area, affecting multiple targets simultaneously. The psyker must nominate a single point in space anywhere within range and line of sight. If the Focus Power test is successful, then every target within the radius of the Psychic Blast is hit by the power.\n\n## Gaining Psychic Powers\n\nA character can only use psychic powers he has purchased. Any character with a psy rating of 1 or higher can purchase powers by spending experience points gained during play. To purchase a psychic power, a character must meet all its prerequisites. The amount of experience points required to purchase a psychic power is listed in that power's entry.\n\n## Power Format\n\nEach psychic power is presented using the following format:\n\n**Name:** The power's name.\n\n**Cost:** This number represents the amount of experience required to learn the power. Psychic powers are purchased with experience points.\n\n**Prerequisites:** Some techniques require the psyker to have first learnt other ways to use his abilities. He must possess the powers (or other prerequisites) listed in order to learn the power.\n\n**Action:** The Focus Power action required to activate the power. This is usually a Free Action, Half Action, Full Action, Reaction, or an Extended Action.\n\n**Focus Power:** This states the characteristic used in Focus Power tests to activate this power (normally Willpower, but occasionally other characteristics are used), and whether the Focus Power test is Opposed. The difficulty of the power is also noted here.\n\n**Range:** The range at which the power can be used is usually expressed in metres or kilometres, multiplied by the PR at which the power was used. If the range is a radius, this is always measured with the psyker at its centre. Radius applies to a sphere around the psyker and so will extend up, down, and in every other direction.\n\n**Sustained:** This states whether the power can be sustained, and what action is required to sustain the power. This entry will always be one of the following: No, Free Action, Half Action, or Full Action.\n\n**Subtype:** This denotes the specific action subtypes for the Focus Power test of the power. For more information on action subtypes see Combat.\n\n**Effect:** This details the power's rules, including variables that the psyker's effective psy rating, or the degrees of success from the Focus Power test, have on the power's final strength. Whenever a power's description refers to the psyker's psy rating, it means the psyker's effective psy rating for the power, not his base psy rating.\n\n**Psychic Phenomena:** Some unusual powers cause alternate or additional Psychic Phenomena. If the power uses only the normal Psychic Phenomena rules, this section will be absent.\n","excerpt":"# Psykers  Psykers are beings with the ability to manipulate the power of the Immaterium, bending the chaotic energy to their will to manifest potent psychic powers.

To create an item, a character needs three things: the right skill, materials, and time.\n\n## Crafting skills\n\nThere are five different kinds of crafting skills, each one covering the creation of different kinds of items.\n\n### Linguistics\n\nThis skill allows a character to to compose moving, informative, and influential works of prose and poetry in the languages in which they are trained.\n\n### Medicae\n\nThis skill allows a character to create all manner of drugs and poisons. With the GM's permission, players can even create new drugs and poisons based on the venom of slain creatures or to mimic the effects of certain environments (note that here a character always needs at least a small sample of the original substance).\n\n### Survival\n\nThis skill allows a character to create any kind of basic device or basic item such as clothing or foodstuffs. Survival can be used to craft any item with the Primitive special quality or any Low-tech Weapon. With the GM's permission, players can also create any simple item with this skill, provided it can be fashioned from unprocessed materials and lacks any complex moving parts (i.e., clothing, a cart, a hovel, etc.).\n\n### Tech-Use\n\nThis skill allows a character to create complex or technical devices such as those commonly created within the forges of Imperial worlds. With the GM's permission, any weapon, armour, explosive, or piece of tech can be created using this skill. Unlike things made with Survival and Medicae, however, many items created using this skill are fiendishly complex, or their designs a closely guarded secret, and are only available to characters with the right knowledge and access to advanced workshops.\n\n### Trade\n\nThis skill allows a character to manufacture things, from inspiring sculpture to mighty starships. What can be created depends on the speciality. Like items made with Tech-Use, these often require advanced workshops and specialised materials. Trade crafting often involves fashioning new, unique items of personal design, and thus do not always require detailed plans for the item. Major projects, such as vehicles or huge statuary, should require large amounts of time, with the GM altering the Time listings from hours to days or even months and longer.\n\n## Materials\n\nWhen creating an item, a character must first have access to the right materials. Whether these materials are on hand is up to the GM, though common sense should play a part (i.e., a character on a feral world is going to have access to many basic materials good for the Survival skill, but might have trouble finding the parts needed to make an autogun). Once it has been determined whether the materials are on hand, the GM then decides if the character needs to expend any resources acquiring them. As a general rule, when creating items using the Tech-Use skill (or the Medicae skill when creating advanced drugs, such as those not occurring naturally), characters must always buy materials. Items crafted with Survival, on the other hand, can other be made from \"found\" materials, such as fashioning a bow when in a forest, or making a spear from scrap metal in an underhive.\n\nWhen acquiring materials for crafting, determine the item's Availability and then decrease it by one level (i.e., Average items become Common, Common items become Plentiful, etc.). The character then makes a Requisition test to acquire the materials just as if he were acquiring an item. Once he has the materials, he can then try to create the item.\n\n## Time\n\nCreating an item takes time and is always an Extended test set by the GM. The length of the test and the time it takes depends on the complexity of the item. While both these factors are up to the GM, he can use Table: Crafting Items as a guideline. The Game Master can also modify Crafting tests depending on factors such as the presence of assistants, the workshop or lab available, the levels of funding or materials available, and the quality of each. The Time listed in Table: Crafting Items are meant to represent the amount of time spent during each individual skill test, not the entire time taken to create the item.\n\n## Fruits of your Labour\n\nIn most cases, what the character gets out of crafting an item is obvious, its the new sword or lasgun or batch of drugs that they just spent all that time on. In other cases, such as the works of art produced by the Trade or Linguistics skills, its less obvious. For these works, the typical end goal is for them to be appreciated by the masses, or to appeal to a wealthy patron. At the GM's discretion, the artists may gain 1, or more for particularly good results, Influence, to represent their name spreading, or the eye of an appreciative noble upon them.\n","excerpt":"# Crafting  | **TYPE OF ITEM** | **TIME** | **EXTENDED TEST SUCCESSES** |"},{"srdPath":"skills/exploration","title":"Exploration","content":"# Exploration\n\nRogue Trader is a story-driven game that involves lots of travel, exploration, and hopefully, the acquisition of wealth. This section explains additional rules for conducting the business of a Rogue Trader organisation — to venture into the unknown, explore, exploit, and conquer. There are two main groups of Skills characters are likely to rely on heavily during their travels, Exploration Skills and Investigation Skills. Both groups provide many interesting opportunities for individuals to grab a few moments in the spotlight. However, Skill Tests should not be used to replace roleplaying—instead they should be used to augment roleplaying and encourage total group participation.\n\n## Using Exploration Skills\n\nExploration Skills can help achieve a multitude of objectives, from prowling the remains of a derelict space hulk in search of ancient technology to surveying a planetary surface for rich mineral veins. Exploration Skills differ from Investigation Skills in that Exploration Skills tend to focus on searching or examining locations in order to find out what is there.\n\n## Exploration Challenges\n\n| Challenge Complexity | Degrees of Success Needed |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Simple** | 3 |\n| **Taxing** | 6 |\n| **Involved** | 12 |\n\nWhen a group of characters wishes to apply their collective specialities to an exploration task, the GM can create an Exploration Challenge. This is simply an expanded version of a Skill Test where multiple characters can attempt to contribute to the success of the challenge over an extended period of time. To create an Exploration Challenge, the GM considers the nature and overall complexity of the challenge and assigns a total number of degrees of success necessary to complete the challenge. Table Exploration Challenges provides some example guidelines. \n\nDuring an Exploration Challenge, each participating character can make a Skill Test using any Exploration Skill he possesses, though the GM may rule that certain Skills provide no meaningful help to task at hand. The same character can make multiple tests, but each time he must chose a different Exploration Skill. Likewise, the same Exploration Skill can be tested multiple times, but only if it is attempted by a different character each time. It is up to the players to decide the order of the Exploration Skill Tests. The default difficulty of each individual Exploration Skill Test is Challenging (+0), but this can change depending on the outcome of previous tests made in the challenge. \n\nOn a success, the difficulty of the next Exploration Skill Test has its difficulty reduced by one step. Furthermore, each degree of success contributes an equal number of degrees of success toward completing the Exploration Challenge. Conversely, a failure on an individual Exploration Skill Test increases the difficulty of the next Exploration Skill Test by one step. Furthermore, for each degree of failure remove one degree of success toward completing the Exploration Challenge. Explorers can use Fate Points to affect the outcome of Exploration Challenges if they wish.\n\n### Failing an Exploration Challenge\n\nIf the explorers collectively test all of their Exploration Skills without accumulating enough degrees of success to complete the Exploration Challenge, they fail the challenge and are delayed. The exact consequences of such a delay are largely up to the GM, but the explorers should never be faced with a permanent, insurmountable failure. Instead, the explorers could be forced to return their ship or base of operations and formulate a new strategy, or they could be temporarily stuck in a dangerous environment where their very survival is at stake. Whatever the consequences, the GM should eventually give them another chance to tackle the Exploration Challenge.\n","excerpt":"# Exploration  Rogue Trader is a story-driven game that involves lots of travel, exploration, and hopefully, the acquisition of wealth.

In combat, an accomplished acrobat can somersault, flip, or cartwheel away from foes, twisting his body out of reach of his enemy or slipping past foes in a blur of motion. Often, characters develop a knack for Acrobatics as part of their training in another field. A courier or thief might learn these knacks as part of travel through densely populated areas. Gladiators, survivalists, and dancers need to be able to perform acrobatic motions as part of their daily routines.

In these cases, the character often starts with only a rough map or a blank parchment and must first construct the guide.

Psyniscience also allows detection of psychic phenomena, disturbances, voids, or other areas where the flow of the Immaterium has been unsettled or disrupted. The difficulty for a Psyniscience test is based upon the potency of any nearby Warp activity. In general, the more powerful the activity, the easier it may be to sense. At the same time, by attempting to identify such a presence, a character must temporarily open his mind to its influence. Particularly potent threats may be able to seize this opportunity, and react aggressively to the probe.

When placing explosives, make sure to note the total degrees of success and the die roll, as it might be used in an Opposed test if someone attempts to defuse a character's hard work. Defusing charges also falls under the Tech-Use skill, with an Opposed test against the Tech-Use skill test of the individual who set the explosives. Winning the test indicates that the bomb has been defused. Simple failure means that while the charge has not been disarmed, neither has it gone off. Four or more degrees of failure indicate the character has set off the device, suffering the consequences of the explosion.

These should be conducted in any circumstance where success or failure might have a meaningful impact upon the scenario. \n\n**_Routine tasks attempted under normal conditions should never require a test_**. \n\nHowever, if there is a reasonable chance of failure due to environmental conditions or circumstance, even a routine test might be relevant.\n\nWhen a character uses a skill to perform a task, he must succeed at a skill test. The procedure follows the normal test rules: the player rolls, compares the result to the characteristic best suited to the task and, if the result is equal to or less than the skill rating, the check succeeds. Modifiers are applied to take into account any environmental factors, as well as the character's rank with the applicable skill.\n\n## Untrained Skill Use\n\nIt is unlikely that a character will be trained in the use of every skill, instead focusing on the mastery of a few and a general knowledge of a handful of others. A character can, however, still use skills in which he has no training when needs must, such as attempting to hide from a slavering group of mutants or frantically deciphering the coded messages in an ancient tome. In these instances, the character makes a skill test as normal but suffers a –20 penalty in addition to any other modifiers.\n\nThe only exceptions to this rule are Specialist skills (see below) which require a level of ability that simply cannot be attempted by the untrained. These could include knowledge of ancient rites of the Adeptus Mechanicus, commanding a Mars Class Cruiser, or speaking fluently with an Eldar Corsair in its own xenos language. Specialist skills are indicated as such in the individual skill descriptions.\n\n### Special Uses\n\nSeveral skill entries have subsections that detail a specific, focused use outside their usual employment. These sections spotlight particularly creative or interesting uses of the skill, allowing for greater variety of applications. Special uses and their effects can be found at the end of each relevant skill description.\n\n## Specialist Skills\n\nSome skills are not just one skill but many, representing a specialisation within the skill itself. These are known as Specialist skills, and whenever a character learns a Specialist skill, he must choose a particular specialisation within it. Specialisations represent such things as specific knowledge of places, people, and events; the ability to control, drive, or pilot particular types of vehicles and equipment; the ability to read and understand maps, as well as the ability to plot a course across a world or the stars themselves; and the ability to speak, read, or understand one of the countless languages, codes, or glyphs used by the races of the 41st Millennium.\n\nA character can take a Specialist skill more than once, taking a new speciality each time he takes the skill. If he takes a Specialist skill more than once (each with its own speciality), then these are treated as separate skills and must be advanced in rank individually.\n\nA list of the individual specialities within each Specialist skill can be found within the individual skill descriptions\n\n## Time and Skill Tests\n\nThe amount of time required for a skill test may vary substantially based both upon the skill used and the particular instance of its use. A Tech-Use test to clear a weapon jam might take only a few moments, though one to perform a basic repair on a vehicle could take hours. Similarly, a Commerce test to negotiate the price of supplies for a journey might be resolved quickly, but a complex negotiation to establish a trade agreement between two powerful mercantile groups could take days.\n\nEach skill entry includes guidance on the average amount of time that skill usually takes to perform. These values are either measured in actions (in the case of skills that can be performed during a round of structured time), or minutes/hours. Some skills are most commonly used in reaction to, or in combination with, another skill. In these instances, the amount of time required is identical to the skill it is used to oppose or assist. Keep in mind that these values serve as guidelines but are not always fixed. Game Masters must alter the time required for a skill use based upon the overall complexity of the task involved.\n\n### Trying Again\n\nMany tasks can be attempted repeatedly with few consequences until a character finally succeeds. A character using Inquiry to research vital information might decide, for example, he will keep examining data until he finally finds the vital clue necessary to answer a crucial question. In such a situation the GM could determine how long this might take based on a single roll, with the character's only cost the narrative time and effort involved, rather than have the player make a series of rolls until he is successful.\n\nOther tasks can have serious repercussions if failed. A character attempting to bypass an alarm system might trigger a response on a failed Security test, and further attempts might have to be made while avoiding a patrol sent to investigate the first failure.\n\nSome tasks can only be attempted once, and there is no second chance. A character attempting to leap a chasm could face serious damage or even death on a failed Athletics test. If a character uses Operate to land an Arvus lighter and rolls poorly, the craft might crash into the docking bay, destroying the ship and its crew.\n\nWhere appropriate, a skill entry lists whether it can be attempted more than once, and gives suggestions for the consequences of failure. GMs must be familiar with these options, but can temper them given the particular circumstance of the attempt. A character who failed a test that normally only has a single opportunity might have an additional chance if there are mitigating circumstances. Similarly, a test that could normally be repeated indefinitely might have situational constraints that prevent further opportunities.\n\n## Skill Descriptors\n\nSome skills fall into broad categories that use common rules. Skill descriptors allow players to quickly identify what kind of test is needed and how it is resolved. These categories include: Combat, Crafting, Interaction, Investigation, and Movement.\n\n### Combat Skills\n\nSkills with this descriptor are used in the heat of battle. They are often made in reaction to an enemy's blows, with a basic skill test and the resulting degrees of success or failure determining how well the user acquitted himself in the attempt.\n\n### Crafting Skills\n\nSkills with the Crafting descriptor allow Acolytes to fashion things from parts or raw materials. These can vary from exotic drugs and custom weapons to disturbing works of art and fiendish traps. The GM sets up an appropriate Extended test for the task, and its resolution follows the guidelines in Crafting\n\n### Interaction Skills\n\nAll skills with the Interaction descriptor involve interplay with others. The difficulty of these skill tests depends on the individual's disposition towards the character, as defined by the GM in accordance with the circumstances of the encounter.\n\n#### Interaction Skills and Crowds\n\nIt is possible for a veteran commander or masterful orator to influence or control a number of people at the same time. When a character uses a skill with the Interaction descriptor, he can (if he chooses) affect a number of people up to ten times his Fellowship bonus, provided they can all clearly hear and understand him. If it is an Opposed test, then the character only makes one roll and compares the result to a roll for the group of people (or its leader) he is trying to affect to determine success.\n\n### Investigation Skills\n\nMost of the skills with the Investigation descriptor allow characters to collect information from various sources, and also require Extended tests as characters try to gather detailed intelligence on their suspects or their mission. The GM sets up the proper time period for the test, as it takes far longer to uncover the secret base of a rival cult than it does to spot the location of an armoured column.\n\n### Movement Skills\n\nSkills with the Movement descriptor all relate to a character's mobility, anything from daring leaps across chasms to climbing up sheer cliffs. They involve the ability to move across, through, over, or between elements of a character's environment. Movement skills are all adversely affected by reductions to the character's mobility (such as crippling injuries to limbs) or environmental factors.\n\n## Gaining Skills\n\nAs characters survive adventures and develop during game play, they naturally become more competent, and the range of their abilities grows and strengthens. A Player Character learns new skills and improves existing ones, getting steadily better and gaining access to new options during play and new ways of overcoming challenges. Skills, like other kinds of advances, are gained during character creation or bought during play by spending experience points. The amount of experience points a skill costs depends upon its rank and which aptitudes a character has.\n\n### Skill Ranks\n\nSimply knowing a skill is very different from having mastered its use, and different characters can use different skills at varying levels. To represent this, all of a character's skills are ranked from 1–4, representing his level of ability. At Rank 1, the character no longer suffers the -20 penalty for being untrained. Each rank beyond first grants a cumulative +10 bonus. Characters only use the highest bonus available to them; for example, an Acolyte with Rank 3 in Intimidate gets +20 on all tests with the skill, not +20 for Experienced and +10 for Trained.\n\n## Alternate Characteristics\n\nEvery skill has a base characteristic indicated in its description which is used to test against when making a skill test. Most of the time this is the one a character uses to determine success or failure. In many circumstances when setting a skill test, though, another characteristic could be more fitting. Some example situations could include the following:\n\n- An Acolyte wishing to Intimidate a spire prince into allowing the warband passage across a treasured hive garden might use Willpower rather than Strength for the test.\n- A faltering cogitator's delicate repair could call on Agility rather than Intelligence for the Tech-Use test attempt.\n- Crafting an elaborate forgery designed to deceive a senior bureaucrat might take Intelligence rather than Fellowship in order for it to fool experts and back up the deception.\n\nIn such cases, the GM is highly encouraged to use the characteristic which best suits the situation; Skill entries includes possible alternative characteristics as suggestions. The decision to use them could substantially impact the character's chance of success, and must be made before the character attempts the test.\n","excerpt":"# Using Skills  Throughout the course of a game session, the Game Master frequently calls upon players to make skill tests for their characters. These should be conducted in any circumstance where success or failure might have a meaningful impact upon the scenario. "},{"srdPath":"social_encounters","title":"Social Encounters","content":"# Social Encounters \n\nConflict is key in any drama. It is the same for roleplaying games. Without adversity, PCs would rampage through any plot the Game Master came up with, making for a sterile and unpleasant experience. Many view conflict as combat--the physical act of fighting and shooting--and in most cases this is true. Conflict, however, can be far more than physical combat. Every interaction, whether it is between the PCs in the Compact or the many NPCs they encounter, is a potential conflict. In this scenario words, body language, and status are the weapons and can be as devastating as a shell from a bolter. Those dedicated to personality and social skills excel in these situations, where the goal is not to slay the foe, but to seduce, persuade, deceive, or manipulate the target into performing an even greater deed--whether knowingly or not. What follows are a set of rules bringing these situations to the fore and allowing those PCs with a flair and skill set for grandstanding to shine. While in theory a PC can complete a Social Conflict as a series of mechanical dice-based tests, the following encourages players to bring their wit, fast talking, and debating skills to the table. This can create a rewarding experience, easily as fulfilling as ripping the head from your foe. This section describes Social Conflicts, and also explains how PCs can use the system for far more than just one-on-one conflicts. Great orators have swayed whole nations to go to war in the past; an accomplished PC of could have the ability to persuade crowds to rebel, topple governments, and turn entire populations, all without even swinging a chainsword in anger. Once a character can do any of this, then he is truly on the path to becoming a PC who is feared or revered throughout the Sector.\n\n## What Is a Social Conflict? \n\nA Social Conflict is a situation where two or more protagonists become locked in a verbal encounter in which there are consequences for whoever triumphs as well as the participant who loses. It can take many forms, from an organised debate to an impromptu argument, a discussion at a banquet table with veiled threats and subtle insults being passed around along with the condiments, a ritualistic sparring session where invectives are traded instead of physical blows, a conclave where two proponents wish to run a forthcoming operation in very different ways, a court of peers judging a defendant to decide his guilt, a jovial contest to find the lewdest member of the group, bartering for services against a rival equally desperate, manipulating a planetary official by leveraging his pride into signing a contract, or even a character calling out the Arch-Heretic in front of his followers to make a play for power. All these examples and much more besides could be classed as a Social Conflict and benefit from the following rules. In a physical combat, it is relatively easy to decide who the victors and losers are; normally within the brutal exchanges of Black Crusade it is the party still standing. However, things are not so clean cut in a Social Conflict. The loser may not acquire physical injury--although this is possible in certain situations--but there are inevitable repercussions, certainly a loss of standing and stature amongst the loser's peers and superiors, but there is also the mental state to take into consideration. The loser will be temporarily confounded, his beliefs may be shaken, the encounter may well have placed him in certain jeopardy, or he might be left reeling from the verbal assault. In any case, his mental defences will be momentarily weakened, his resolution drained and so will be suggestible and easier to manipulate than normal. As well as the personal price for losing a Social Conflict, there are also the contextual consequences the Game Master needs to take into account. This could be no more than a loss of face, but if the PC is bargaining for his life, or petitioning a powerful and hostile Lord for aid, then the aftermath will be far more dramatic. In this way, a Social Conflict acts as a trigger for unlocking even greater tension and peril within the game. Game Masters should use it as a tool in that regard, playing through the system is an exciting and fulfilling experience, but the outcome can be equally spectacular if the stakes are high enough.\n\n### Entering into a Social Conflict \n\nBefore detailing how a Social Conflict works, the Game Master must decide when the game shifts into a Social Conflict. This is entirely at the GM's discretion; there are no hard and fast rules and, just like physical combat, in most cases it is obvious when the game is ripe for Social Conflict. If there is doubt, the Game Master should ask himself the following few questions:\n\n-   Is the conflict likely to be a sustained encounter?\n-   Are there spectators present?\n-   Will the outcome place the Heretics in peril or gain them a boon?\n-   Is the encounter a pivotal moment within the adventure?\n\nIf the answer is yes to any of the above, then a Social Conflict is more than justified.\n\n## Social Conflict Rules \n\nThe following sequence describes how a Social Conflict works in Black Crusade. To start with, it details the most basic and likely scenario--that of a single player character engaging in a Social Conflict with a formidable NPC. There are also expanded rules to incorporate much larger conflicts, with paired or entire Compact based attacks against rival groups or gaining the will of large crowds. In a social confrontation, the participants' Willpower, Fellowship, Influence, and occasionally, Perception characteristics are used. The base system is as follows:\n\n-   **Willpower** determines how many \"rounds\" a confrontation lasts. In an abstract way, it reflects a participant's health. Every time a player or NPC loses a round his Willpower is diminished. Once all Willpower is lost, then the participant is effectively beaten. He may not be physically harmed, but his resolve to continue the confrontation has gone, and he becomes very suggestible.\n\n-   **Fellowship** is a measure of how well the participant is at verbal sparring, debating, or in winning over an aggressive audience. A Character who sits back and relies on mechanical dice rolling to do the talking is at a considerable disadvantage. Characters with quick minds, who are able to improvise with cutting rejoinders and their own dazzling wit, can overcome a foe who relies solely on his superior Fellowship Characteristic.\n\n-   **Influence** carries much figurative weight in a Social Conflict. Bystanders are much more likely to listen to a participant with a higher Influence, as he is more imposing with a greater reputation. An opponent with less Influence can be easier to intimidate and cowed in front of his peers. In a Social Conflict, Influence is a resource that a player can use strategically to ensure victory over his adversary. In some instances, a participant (normally an NPC) will not have any Influence. In these situations the GM should temporarily assign Influence to the participant on the basis of the forthcoming encounter.\n\n-   **Perception** is used during the conflict at the Game Master's discretion to note how the opponent is fairing in the ongoing verbal and mental exchange. The more Willpower an adversary loses, the more the physical effects show and this, in turn, can be used to further the advantage. For example, a Successful Perception test allows the player to note that his opponent is sweating profusely on his forehead, or that his left cheek has involuntarily started to tick as he fails to deal with another acerbic remark.\n\nThe Characteristics outlined are utilised in the following way during a Social Conflict. Note that the sequence assumes two participants, a Character vs. an NPC (a Player vs. the Game Master). Their are rules for expanding this later in the chapter.\n\n1.  **Note Values:** Once the GM has designated the participants are in a Social Conflict, the player and GM note down their character's respective current Willpower and Influence values.\n\n2.  **Bid Influence:** In a Social Conflict, the participants' Influence level temporarily acts as a bidding reserve. The more Influence is bid, the more devastating a metaphorical blow one could do to the opponent. However, if your foe comes out on top, a Character may have bet his reputation badly. Both participants secretly bid an amount of Influence. This is effectively \"spent\" and is taken from their Influence reserve for the duration of the confrontation.\n\n3.  **Verbal Contact:** The players (or GM) now have a chance to directly influence the scene. The participant with the highest Fellowship has the choice of going first or second (in following rounds, the victor of the previous Fellowship test gets the choice). The participant then gets a chance to say something regarding the issue at hand, or, most likely, a withering put down or insult about his opponent. The second participant will get to respond in a similar fashion. The length and subjects of these diatribes depends entirely on the context of the scene. However, a good rule of thumb is to keep each participant's contribution to the equivalent of a short paragraph (about 5-10 seconds of actual speech), as this keeps the combat short and snappy.\n\n4.  **Determine the Victor:** The Game Master will now decide who has performed the best. He is judging not just on inherent wit, but how in-character each contribution was (note that in many cases, the GM is judging his own input. Of course, most Game Masters are beyond reproach but there are alternative methods to judging the best contributions--see Best in Round). The winner receives a +20 modifier to the following test.\n\n5.  **Fellowship Test:** The participants must then take an Opposed Fellowship test. If both participants fail, then this round has ended in stalemate. Either all parties feel they have (rightly or wrongly) gained the upper hand, or the spectators have failed to come to a consensus on who was winning in that round. Any bid Influence is lost and play repeats from Stage 2. In this instance of an Opposed Test, if the number of Degrees of Successes is tied, then the participant with the highest bid Influence wins instead of the usual situation where a party with the highest Characteristic bonus wins.\n\n6.  **Lose Willpower:** Assuming there is a victor, then the losing participant removes 1d5 Willpower from his total. Any Influence the victor bid is then revealed (if it has not already come into play) and this is added to the lost Willpower total. Influence that the loser bid is lost.\n\n7.  **Physical Manifestation:** If the losing participant takes more than 10 Willpower in a single round, then some physical manifestation of that mental blow shows (sweat, ticks, squirming, stuttering, etc). If the GM thinks it appropriate, a Successful Perception test allows the rival to spot the participant's discomfort. In the following round, if this information is deftly used by the winning participant in the Verbal Contact stage, then he gains a +30 modifier instead of the +20 bonus should he win the phase.\n\n8.  **Victory or Defeat:** The Social Conflict continues using stages 2 through 7 until one party loses all of his Willpower. The remaining participant is considered the winner. The triumphant Heretic immediately regains all lost Characteristic values, bringing him back to normal levels. The losing party recuperates half his Infamy and Willpower as well. The rest returns at a rate the GM decides. A nominal rate is five points per hour, but this is at the GM's discretion and can be exploited for full narrative effect; for example, the loser now has a much weaker Willpower for the next few hours and so is easier to manipulate or far more suggestible.\n\n### Social Opposition \n\nIn a Social Conflict, the default test is an Opposed Characteristic Test using Fellowship. This is because Fellowship represents, in the broadest sense, how a Heretic interacts with others. However, some characters may be more specialised in this arena and are better at intimidating, deceiving, charming, or coaxing an opponent. To represent this, the Game Master can allow a character to use an Interaction Skill-based test instead of the nominal Fellowship Characteristic. The actual skill used depends on how the player performed in the previous Verbal Contact phase; if he was charming and eloquent, then he could use the Charm Skill for example, assuming he has it. Alternatively, if he barked orders, expecting them to be obeyed with nary a glance at his opponent, then the Command Skill could be more suitable, or even the Intimidate Skill. In summary, how the player (or NPC) reacts and performs in the Verbal Contact phase determines which Skill he can use in the following Opposed Test. Additionally, any Talents or Traits associated with these Skills can also be used if relevant. Talents such as Air of Authority, Cold Hearted, Disturbing Voice, Lexographer, Mimic, and Pity the Weak all have an effect during a Social Conflict. Even Traits such as Fear or the Stuff of Nightmares can have an impact during the encounter should the GM allow.\n\n### Overawe \n\nInfluence is reputation. It is a powerful metaphorical force that cannot easily be ignored. If Abaddon the Despoiler, leader of the 13th Black Crusade and battle-brother to Horus himself, strode into a chamber flanked by his Chosen bodyguard, it is almost inconceivable that a lowly Heretic would call him out, or flat out insult him. That is the power of a high Influence score. Attacking such a being in a social context should feel intimidating, and an uphill struggle. Game Masters can replicate this type of situation at the start of a Social Conflict using Overawe. \n\nUnder this rule, the character with the lower Influence score must immediately make a Willpower Test to enter into a Social Conflict with his opponent. The test is modified with a penalty equal to ten times the difference of the Influence Bonus between the two Characters. If the character passes the test, he has overcome the raw presence of his foe and can engage in the Social Conflict as normal. However, if the character fails the test, then his own Influence pool is immediately reduced by half and he must lose 1d5 Willpower, as if he'd lost the first round of the Social Conflict. All Characteristic losses are in context of the following Social Conflict and are not permanent. Should the character find himself in this position, then he may voluntarily withdraw from the social encounter before it begins. His would-be opponent is simply too formidable for the character, and he rethinks verbal conflict before entering into something he would struggle to recover from, let alone triumph over.\n\n### Best in Round \n\nStage 4 of a Social Conflict is a very subjective part of the sequence. The GM needs to judge the contribution of both participants in the previous stage (Verbal Contact) and decide which was the best, rewarding the winner with a crucial bonus. Here the GMs decisions and actions are above reproach. However, in the majority of Social Conflicts the GM will be playing one of the participants. To some, it may seem odd or jarring that the GM is the final arbitrator of the best rejoinder, when he himself is a participant. Should the group feel another method is needed then below are some options:\n\n-   **Blind Vote:** All non-participating players vote for one of the participants on a folded piece of paper, and the character with the most votes wins. Do not assume the PC simply vote for their fellow players, for good role players should reward the finest insults and wittiest retorts whoever makes them.\n-   **Noise-gauge:** A more instantaneous and instinctual method is to have the non-participating players give their response as jeers, cheers, applause, or whatever natural reaction is the group consensus. The spectators must wait until the contribution is finished and then make their noise of appreciation or derision. The other participant then makes his contribution and players will respond once more. Whichever side got the greatest or loudest response is the winner and gains the bonus for the following Fellowship Test. This is a quicker and simpler method than the Blind Vote but also lacks a way for players to deliberately vote against their peer.\n-   **A Third Party:** Another method relies on someone else, who isn't a player or the GM, and is happy to take an impartial stance and witness the entire Social Conflict in an unbiased fashion. In Stage 4 he chooses which participant gave the best contribution. This method can work at gaming clubs, conventions, or anywhere there are fellow gamers who are not necessarily playing in the campaign. A Social Conflict played out in this situation can actually gather quite a crowd as onlookers take in and enjoy the players' verbal sparring. Participants will need to have their wit well and truly sharpened. If there is a crowd, they can potentially act as a Noise-gauge as well. No matter which method used to judge the contributions, it is important to note that everyone should be having a good time. All insults, verbal attacks, and threats must be in character and in context of the game. This system is not about starting real arguments, but aiding in conquering the galaxy!\n\n## Talents and Traits \n\nJust like other tests, some Skills, Talents, and Traits can affect Social Conflicts. Skills have already been mentioned, in that a character can use a Skill instead of his Fellowship for the Opposed Test if appropriate, and the player's performance in the Verbal Contact stage is commensurate to a Skill in his repertoire. However, Talents and some Traits can have variable possible effects in a Social Conflict. The list below presents the Talents that have a direct effect in a Social Conflict, and a summary of their effect. See the full talent description for more details.\n\n-   **Air of Authority:** +10 when using Command\n-   **Cold Hearted:** Opposed Charm tests incur +20\n-   **Disturbing Voice:** +10 when using Intimidate\n-   **Inspire Wrath:** +10 to allies' Infamy reserve\n-   **Lexographer:** +20 when in a Social Conflict in a different language\n-   **Master Orator:** d10 Willpower against multiple foes\n-   **Mimic:** d10 Willpower loss\n-   **Nerves of Steel:** +20 against Intimidate\n-   **Peer:** +20 to Infamy reserve\n-   **Pity the Weak:** Bonuses to Command and Intimidate\n-   **Unremarkable:** +20 to Deceive; lose half Infamy Reserve\n\nTraits usually represent an innate or physical aspect of a character, and the majority of Traits have a limited impact in a Social Conflict. However, some Traits undeniably influence a social encounter, especially if that Trait describes a character's unusual physical aspect or countenance. Bestial, Daemonic, Fear, From Beyond, Incorporeal, Multiple Arms, Size, Stuff of Nightmares, and Swarm are all Traits that could have an impact. This is not an exhaustive list though; if the GM thinks another Trait can affect a social encounter, then it should also qualify for the following rule. A character with such Traits can have a positive, neutral, or negative effect in the forthcoming encounter at the GM's discretion. This depends on the context; a Heretic who causes Fear is a boon when attempting to cow or intimidate an opponent, for example, but can be a hindrance when trying to charm or assuage a target. The GM should summarise if a character's Traits give the Heretic an overall positive, negative, or neutral contribution. A modifier is then awarded: +10 for a positive effect, -10 for a negative connotation, and +0 for neutral. This is used along with the other modifiers in the Opposed Fellowship or Skill tests. A character's Traits can affect a Social Conflict even if he is not the primary contributor. A character who is providing Assistance or part of a Compact, group, or crowd Social Conflict can have his Traits taken into account as described above.\n\n## Groups vs. Groups \n\nA Social Conflict that is dealing with multiple participants on both sides is a distinct possibility. There are several ways for a Game Master to run this situation. Firstly, he can pair up opponents, and then run them as a series of Social Conflicts. It is rare to get an even match-up so one participant may have to deal with two or more opponents; this is covered in the Two or More vs. One sidebar on this page. The other method is to establish a Compound Social Conflict. In this situation, the encounter is divided into the two opposing groups. Both sides add their entire Willpower and Infamy together. This creates each groups' Infamy reserve and Willpower level. A Social Conflict then continues as described above using the collected Infamy and Willpower scores, with a few additional exceptions. At the start of every round, each group nominates a single speaker; it is this character who performs in the Verbal Contact stage. The group can choose a new speaker at the start of every round, or the same speaker can stay in the role. When making the Opposed Fellowship or Skill Test, a speaker can have Assistance as normal. The losing side must lose 1d10+10 Willpower in addition to the equal amount of Infamy the victorious side bid. On conclusion of the Social Conflict, each member of the losing side individually regains only half of his Willpower and Infamy back. The remainder returns at five points per half hour, a much faster rate than normal as the group has shared the burden of the loss and is more resilient than a single combatant. The winning group has their Characteristics immediately restored back to pervious levels as normal.\n\n### Two or More vs. One \n\nThere are situations where a single character may find himself entering into a Social Conflict against a larger group. First, it is important to define the active participants. A Social Conflict often takes place before an audience of vested spectators, such as minions and serfs, or gawkers. These are not active participants-- an audience does not get onstage with the actor. Assuming the scenario is truly an uneven one, with a lone character in a Social Conflict with a group containing two or more participants, then the following guidelines should be used. The larger group must nominate a speaker; unlike in a Compound Social Conflict, the speaker cannot change. In effect, the rest of the Social Conflict is between these two participants, and should be treated as such in regard to Willpower, Infamy reserves, etc. However, the speaker of the larger group gets the advantage of being able to seek and receive Assistance from his partners.\n\n## Crowd Control \n\nCharacters can find themselves encountering large groups, and not just armies or enemy factions intent on killing them. Hab-slaves on their way to the pits, galley-dregs labouring in the depths of a cruiser, lost colonists who have forgotten the Imperium, even a xenos race staring in wonder at the alien players--all can be useful tools if turned to the Character's cause. Riots, rebellions, and regicides have happened throughout history and often it has been a few charismatic and opportunistic individuals that have sparked the flames of such \"liberty.\" Learning to control and manipulate the mob is a useful ability to have, for a crowd that is hostile to the Characters is clearly more difficult to influence than an ambivalent one. The larger the crowd, however, the more intransigent it is. The GM can use a variant of the Social Conflict rules to indicate how successful the players are in swaying a crowd, but note that a crowd is a different entity to a rival group (which is covered earlier). A crowd is a more passive entity, although if angered, a mob can quickly turn violent against the Characters. Before the Characters can tackle the crowd, the Game Master must define it through two questions:\n\n-   How large is the crowd?\n-   What is the crowd's Disposition?\n\nThe size of the crowd determines its collective Willpower. The crowd's Disposition decides the Disposition modifier. See Tables Size of Crowd and Crowd Disposition to determine these levels. Once a crowd has been defined, the Characters can try and sway it to their cause. This is performed similarly to a Social Conflict, with some key differences. First, if a Compact is talking to a crowd, then the group must select a speaker. The speaker can receive Assistance from his fellow Characters as normal. The speaker must note down his Infamy reserve and Willpower as usual. He can attempt to Overawe the audience; to do this the GM assumes the crowd has Infamy equal to its Collective Willpower. A crowd successfully Overawed loses 1d10+10 Willpower instead of the usual d5. The speaker can now bid Infamy from his reserve. In the Verbal Contact stage the player performs his contribution. Unlike a normal Social Conflict, there is no direct opponent, the player is speaking to the crowd so must make a rousing or terrifying speech to affect the mob before him. The GM rates the contribution, and awards an appropriate modifier ranging from +20 for a good contribution to -20 for one that would not please the audience. The speaker must now take a Fellowship test (or a Skill-based test depending on how the player performed), bearing in mind the cumulative modifiers for the Crowd Disposition, Assistance, Talents, hecklers, supporters, and any award or penalty from the verbal contribution. If the test is passed, then the crowd loses d5 Willpower plus the amount equal to any bid Infamy. If the test is failed, then the Character must lose d5 Willpower, plus the amount equal to his bid Infamy. Note in a failed test, Infamy is not lost as normal but is used to sap the Character's own Willpower; this represents the Character becoming deflated and anxious as his attempts to rouse the audience fall on deaf ears. Rounds continue in this way until either the crowd or the Character has lost all Willpower. If the Character wins, then the crowd can be swayed. It is now willing to do a single simple task under the Character's direction, such as begin rioting or march upon their sovereign's palace, but is unable to take more complex direction such as executing an elaborate battle plan, as the Characters are dealing with a fragile group mentality. If the Character loses, then he suffers the normal penalties for failing in a Social Conflict and the crowd turns hostile; the group needs an exit strategy or must resort to more brutal methods to get what they want. If at any point the speaker rolls a natural 100, then the crowd immediately turns aggressive and sets about the Character and his comrades. Treat the crowd as a Horde attack of Magnitude equal to their current Willpower; hopefully, the Characters have prepared for such a contingency.\n\n### Hecklers and Supporters \n\nAn optional rule when swaying crowds is to allow for hecklers and supporters. To do this, note the Degrees of Success or Failure when making a Fellowship or Skill Test. Every Degree of Failure represents a heckler in the crowd, jeering the speaker, and counts as a -10 penalty in the following test in the next round only. Every Degree of Success represents a supporter, a member of the crowd that embraces the Characters' cause. Every supporter gives the player a +10 modifier in the following Fellowship or Skill test in the next round only.\n\n### Size of Crowd\n| Crowd Number | Collective Willpower | \n| --- | --- | \n| 0-10 | 10 | \n| 11-50 | 20 | \n| 51-100 | 30 | \n| 101-300 | 40 | \n| 301-1000 | 50 | \n| 1001-2000 | 60 | \n| 2001-5000 | 70 | \n| 5001-10,000 | 80 | \n| 10,001+ | 90 | \n\n### Crowd Disposition\n| Crowd Descriptor | Difficulty Modifier | \n| --- | --- | \n| Accepting | Ordinary +10 | \n| Ambivalent | Challenging +0 | \n| Antagonistic | Difficult -10 | \n| Hostile | Hard -20 | \n","excerpt":"# Social Encounters   Conflict is key in any drama. It is the same for roleplaying games. Without adversity, PCs would rampage through any plot the Game Master came up with, making for a sterile and unpleasant experience. Many view conflict as combat--the physical act of fighting and shooting--and in most cases this is true. Conflict, however, can be far more than physical combat. Every interaction, whether it is between the PCs in the Compact or the many NPCs they encounter, is a potential conflict. In this scenario words, body language, and status are the weapons and can be as devastating as a shell from a bolter. Those dedicated to personality and social skills excel in these situations, where the goal is not to slay the foe, but to seduce, persuade, deceive, or manipulate the target into performing an even greater deed--whether knowingly or not. What follows are a set of rules bringing these situations to the fore and allowing those PCs with a flair and skill set for grandstanding to shine. While in theory a PC can complete a Social Conflict as a series of mechanical dice-based tests, the following encourages players to bring their wit, fast talking, and debating skills to the table. This can create a rewarding experience, easily as fulfilling as ripping the head from your foe. This section describes Social Conflicts, and also explains how PCs can use the system for far more than just one-on-one conflicts. Great orators have swayed whole nations to go to war in the past; an accomplished PC of could have the ability to persuade crowds to rebel, topple governments, and turn entire populations, all without even swinging a chainsword in anger. Once a character can do any of this, then he is truly on the path to becoming a PC who is feared or revered throughout the Sector."},{"srdPath":"starships/armoury/archeotech_components","title":"Archeotech Components","content":"[{\"component\":\"Ancient Life Sustainer\",\"hulls\":[\"Transports\",\"Raiders\",\"Frigates\"],\"power\":-2,\"space\":1,\"shipPoints\":2,\"special\":[{\"title\":\"The Air is Sweet\",\"effect\":\"Increase Morale permanently by 2, reduce all losses to Crew Population due to non-combat sources by 1.

The average launch bay on a cruiser-few smaller vessels can spare the internal volume needed to support attack craft operations-carries an assortment of craft, from an abundance of cargo lighters and personnel shuttles, to larger troop dropships, atmospheric craft (sometimes in storage containers, sometimes with limited void-capability for orbital deployment) to anti-ship heavy bombers, assault boats and fighters. This sheer abundance of different craft allows carriers to undertake a wide variety of missions either directly or in support of other vessels.\n\nWhile they are only grudgingly tolerated by many Imperial Navy Battlefleets, numerous Rogue Traders find carriers to be ideal for their purposes, able to as easily serve mercantile interests as military ones. The only factor limiting their spread amongst such eclectic individuals is cost; maintaining dozens of light craft and the skilled crew needed to maintain and operate them is beyond the resources of all but the wealthiest individuals.\n\n## Launch Bay Preparation\n\nOperating a carrier is a complex matter, and many vessels employ a dedicated crew to oversee the minutia of these operations. No launch bay remains at a constant level of complete readiness. Craft are ritually placed into hangar-vaults, their machine spirits slumbering until they are called upon once more, while the deck crews work to ensure that the launch mechanisms and fuel systems function properly, check the ammunition stores, and perform a thousand other minor tasks needed to ensure that the launch bay works smoothly. Preparing a launch bay for operations is a complex process requiring many men to unload and awaken the craft needed, and to ensure that they are fuelled and armed as required.\n\nOutside of battle, this can be done slowly and carefully, taking the time necessary to ensure that no mistakes are made. This is fortunate, as many shuttles and lighters are stubborn and recalcitrant in spirit compared to the fierce and eager spirits of attack craft, and thus take some time to coerce into service. A starship may have one squadron per point of Launch Bay Strength prepared and ready for launch at any one time.\n\nIn the midst of battle, things are a little more hectic, and preflight preparations are afforded much less time. In combat, this takes an Extended Action in which the character performing the Extended Action makes an Ordinary (+10) Command Test in order to make new squadron ready for operations. The maximum number of squadrons that may be made ready simultaneously is equal to the Strength value of the Launch Bay Component being used. Multiple Launch Bay Components may be made ready with a single Extended Action. For more information on what squadrons a launch bay may hold, see \"Room in Launch Bays\".\n\nMost attack craft operations begin the operation by launching attack craft squadrons currently ready in the launch bays. Once a bay has launched squadrons, additional squadrons can be readied for operations-so long as the number of squadrons readied does not exceed the Strength of the Launch Bay. These squadrons can even be launched on subsequent turns. Needless to say, a ship cannot launch more squadrons than it possesses.\n\nThe craft contained within a launch bay can be grouped into five categories for this purpose:\n\n-   Support Craft (small craft designed to support diplomatic and mercantile operations).\n-   Aeronautica (small craft designed to support planetary military operations, including atmospheric fighters, bombers, and troop transports).\n-   Fighters (void-capable craft designed to combat enemy attack craft and ordnance).\n-   Bombers (large void-capable craft designed to attack enemy starships).\n-   Assault Boats (void-capable armoured shuttles designed to deliver boarding parties onto enemy vessels).\n\nThe specifics of using Support Craft and Aeronautica are not given here, but during any endeavour in which such craft are useful, the players earn an additional +25 Achievement Points towards a Military or Trade objective for every point of launch bay Strength their ship possesses.\n\n## Squadrons Below Full Strength\n\nDepending on the fortunes of war, ships may lose attack craft, and be forced to fight with squadrons that are at less than full strength. Determining how many craft a squadron is missing depends on how losses to attack craft squadrons are being tracked. In any case, squadrons that are half strength or lower only provide the +5 bonus (whether attacking with fighters, bombers, or assault craft) for every two additional squadrons, rather than every one.\n\n## Eliminated Squadrons\n\nThroughout these rules, there is a possibility a squadron may be \"eliminated.\" This means the squadron has lost some of its craft, and others may have been damaged. For game purposes, an \"eliminated\" squadron cannot operate in the remainder of the Space Combat they were involved in. (At the GM's discretion and in cases of particularly long combat, this can be changed to a period of two hours, while repairs are made and new craft are activated).\n\nOnce the combat is over, eliminated squadrons can be restored to active duty.\n\n## Small Craft \n\nAs with torpedoes, starships carry a finite supply of small craft, although they often are equipped with large stocks of spare parts, and may even scavenge damaged and derelict interceptors and bombers after battles to refit and reuse them. However, being an attack craft pilot is an extraordinarily dangerous job. The number of possible ways a pilot may meet his end is considerable, and it is no surprise that the Navy's pilots are a superstitious lot, adorning their craft in lucky trinkets, holy relics and non-regulation paint-jobs all intended to bring fortune and longevity to their pilots. There are two ways to track the losses in starship squadrons-the Abstract Method and the Detailed Method.\n\n**Abstract Method:** If the GM and players don't want to track numbers and losses, they can simply elect to make an Upkeep Test for each eliminated attack craft squadron at the end of the battle, using normal Acquisition Test rules. If they fail the Upkeep Test, the squadron counts as half strength. If they fail the Upkeep Test for a half strength squadron, it has been destroyed-the one or two remaining attack craft and their pilots distributed amongst other squadrons to bolster their numbers.\n\n**Detailed Method:** If the GM and players prefer to keep detailed track of their starships, they can use the following method. For every attack craft squadron eliminated, by whatever means, roll 1d10, then subtract the first digit of the squadron's carrier's Crew Rating. The result is how many attack craft were destroyed, up to the maximum number in the squadron. The remainder are simply damaged or out of ammunition. For example, if a carrier with a Crew Rating of 30 had one of its squadrons eliminated, the Explorer commanding the wave rolls 1d10. He gets a \"5,\" then subtracts \"3\" (the first digit in the carrier's Crew Rating). The result, \"2,\" is how many fighters were actually destroyed. The remainder made it back to base safely.\n\nOnce a squadron has lost half its ships, it counts as half strength. Once all ships are lost, it is destroyed. Losses can be replaced using Acquisition Tests.\n\n## Room in Launch Bays \n\nIt is entirely possible that a Rogue Trader won't have a myriad types of small craft available in his launch bay. Such vehicles are extremely expensive, and a Rogue Trader may not see the value in maintaining squadrons of assault boats when all he wants are starfighter interceptors to protect his vessel.\n\nEach point of Strength in a launch bay equates to enough room for one squadron of starfighters, one squadron of bombers, and one squadron of assault boats, support craft, or Aeronautica. These berths can be refurbished to handle different types of small craft, so a launch bay with one point of Strength could be modified to hold two squadrons of fighters and one squadron of support craft, or any number of other combinations. However, for every point of Strength in a launch bay, the bay can hold three squadrons total.\n\nThe size value of squadrons give an idea of how many fighters, bombers, and assault boats may be stored within a launch bay. For support craft and Aeronautica, use the following guidelines:\n\nIn general, Aeronautica can be grouped by type in the same way spaceborn attack craft are-fighters, bombers, and transports. However, Aeronautica are generally smaller than their spaceborn cousins. A squadron of Aeronautica can be up to twice the size of a corresponding spaceborn attack craft-so a wing of 40 Thunderbolt fighters would take up the same space as a squadron of 20 Fury Interceptors.\n\nIn general, support craft take up the same space as assault boats.\n\n## Ships Without Launch Bays \n\nNot every starship has dedicated launch bays to host whole squadrons of attack craft and shuttles. However, most starships have some sort of landing bay with room for shuttles and small craft. Generally, Imperial ships are too large to easily land on a planet's surface, and small craft become vital for loading crew and cargo, and resupplying the vessel.\n\nThe size of these small bays can vary wildly based on a ship's size and class. However, if GMs or players wish to determine how many shuttles a ship may have room for, a useful guideline is that a ship has room for one lighter, shuttle, or heavy lifter for every 5 points of Space its hull has. In general, these vehicles shouldn't be larger than 50 metres. However, if a ship has a cargo hold component (such as the Cargo Hold and Lighter Bay), they should be able to hold an additional four vehicles.\n\n## Craft Ratings \n\nThe types of fighter craft are many and varied. Each spacefaring race approaches fighter craft design differently, and often a single race has several different types of attack craft for different duties. The Imperium, for example, uses the Fury for space superiority, the Starhawk for anti-ship attacks, and the Shark for hit and run raids. All of these small craft have different capabilities, performance tolerance, and effectiveness. In space combat, this is represented by Craft Rating. Craft Rating is a way to represent the performance of a type of attack craft. It is an abstract value representing an attack craft's manoeuvrability, firepower, and durability. This value is represented by a bonus added to certain Tests made when fighters, bombers, and assault boats make attacks. If the GM wants to use an attack craft that does not have a Craft Rating, he can use its Manoeuvrability instead.\n\n## Fighter Operations\n\nOften seen as glory-obsessed and reckless, fighter pilots are nonetheless skilled at their profession, putting their relatively light craft into the maelstrom of combat to take down massively destructive torpedoes and lumbering bombers capable of damaging immense starships. In the broadest of terms, fighters are used in three roles during space combat. These are described below:\n\n## Interception\n\nAs an Extended Action, any number of fighter squadrons currently ready within a ship's launch bays may launch and commence an intercept operation. The fighter squadrons may be grouped up into one or more wings consisting of two or more squadrons, or may operate as independent squadrons, in any combination, as desired. Upon launch and again at the beginning of their parent vessel's subsequent Strategic Turns, the fighter wings may move freely a number of VUs up to the speed of the slowest squadron in the unit. They may continue to remain away from their carrier in this manner for no more than four Strategic Turns, as fuel and life support supplies begin to run low and the fighters are forced to return to their carrier. Squadrons on intercept operations may attack any enemy torpedoes or attack craft within 1VU of their position (whether they enter this range during their movement or enemies enter range during their own turns). Fighter attacks are described later in this section.\n\n## Combat Void Patrol\n\nCommonly referred to as CVP, squadrons of fighters patrol the space around a vessel to protect it from enemy attack. As an Extended Action, any number of fighter squadrons currently ready within a ship's launch bays may commence a CVP operation. A CVP operation may be assigned to the fighters' own carrier or any friendly vessel within a distance equal to the speed of the slowest squadron in the patrol of the carrier, which must remain within that distance while the patrol continues. A patrol can remain in effect indefinitely, as squadrons return to their carrier to resupply periodically as a normal part of the operation. While the CVP remains in effect, any enemy attack craft or torpedoes that move within 5VUs of the patrolled ship are immediately attacked by half of the squadrons performing the patrol (rounding up). The remaining squadrons are either rearming at the time, or are elsewhere on the patrol route. Unlike intercept operations, attacking does not force squadrons to return to their carrier to rearm; such activities are a normal part of CVP operations, and thus the patrol continues even after it has attempted to repel an attack. Spent fighters return to the carrier, rearm, and re-launch on a continuous basis.\n\n## Escort\n\nInstead of operating alone, fighters can be assigned to support bombers or assault boats, protecting them from enemy fighters and harassing defensive turrets to allow their larger brethren to deliver their payloads. Fighter escorts are launched as part of normal bombing or assault boat operations, and move at the same speed as the attack craft they escort. Should the bombers/assault boats be attacked by enemy fighters, then the escorting fighters may attack the enemy fighters. The enemy fighters must engage the escort fighters (see \"Attacking with Fighters\" below). Against defensive turrets, each squadron of escorting fighters impose a -10 penalty on the turrets' Ballistic Skill Test, and will be shot down before any of the escorted bombers/assault boats.\n\n## Attacking with Fighters\n\nIn all cases, where fighters are required to attack enemy small craft, both sides make a Challenging (+0) Command+Craft Rating Test (this will either be from a character aboard the carrier, or from a character leading the fighters personally), with the enemy small craft. Both sides gain a +5 bonus for every squadron of friendly fighters after the first. Both sides also gain a +5 bonus for an additional squadron of bombers or assault craft after the first, plus an additional +5 for each additional two squadrons of bombers or assault craft (as neither bombers nor assault craft are as good at dogfighting as fighters, but are armed and dangerous in numbers). This counts as an Opposed Skill Test, but is not resolved in the same way.\n\nFor every degree of success scored on the Test, one opposing squadron or torpedo is \"eliminated;\" destroyed, damaged or forced to expend their remaining fuel and ammo reserves, and must return to the carrier for rearming and refuelling by the most reasonable direct route. Any remaining squadrons remain in play and can act in later turns, either breaking off and heading for their original target, or staying and engaging. *However, if one side scores at least four degrees of success more than their opponent did, none of that side's squadrons are eliminated no matter what their opponent rolled*. The tactical acumen and impressive piloting skills of the squadron leader's pilots means they scythed through their opposition effortlessly. Craft Rating is essentially an abstract representation of the combat effectiveness of a fighter craft, in terms of weapons, armour, manoeuvrability, and speed.\n\n## Follow My Lead! \n\nIn some instances, Explorers will want to lead attack craft operations themselves. This adds a little additional complication to the process, but also allows these operations to be significantly more successful.\n\nThese rules are intended to be a slightly more abstract option than the vehicle rules, allowing dogfights and piloting to take place in the large context of starship combat.\n\nThrough a mixture of personal skill, outrageous daring and sheer luck, the Explorer leads his subordinates against the enemy, providing a powerful example for them to follow. While piloting a fighter, bomber or assault boat (as appropriate for the squadrons he is leading), the Explorer makes an Opposed Challenging (+0) Operate (Aeronautica)+Craft Rating Test before the Command Test for the squadrons' attack (using the Operate (Aeronautica) Skill of the opposing squadrons, which for NPCs is usually their ship's Crew Rating). If this is successful, then he grants a +5 bonus, plus an additional +5 for every two degrees of success he wins by, to the subsequent Command Test. Additionally, each two degrees of success indicates that the Explorer has shot down one enemy craft, turret, or torpedo personally in the ensuing combat. This has no specific additional effects, but gives the pilot something to brag about.\n\nHowever, if he loses by four or more degrees, then a costly mistake disables his vessel and leaves him stranded in the void. The character suffers 2d10+5 damage, reduced by Toughness Bonus and Armour as normal, from the damage to his craft and cannot participate in any further actions until he has been rescued and brought back to the ship.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy flight is led by a particularly skillful or notorious pilot, the Explorer can elect to duel with him in the void. This is an Opposed Operate (Aeronautica)+Craft Rating Test. The winner gains a +5 bonus, plus an additional +5 for every two degrees of success, to the subsequent Command Test. In addition, if the Explorer wins by three or more degrees, he shoots down the opposing pilot. If he loses by three or more degrees, he suffers the penalty for failing as listed above.\n\n## Bomber Operations\n\nMassive and lumbering compared to other attack craft, bombers carry vast arrays of energy weapons, missiles and bombs designed to damage the thick armoured hulls of starships. With a skilled crew, a bomber can be devastating, using deft manoeuvring to deliver their payload to the weakest parts of a vessel with a degree of precision that cannot be matched by longer-ranged weaponry. As an Extended Action, all bomber squadrons currently ready within a ship's launch bays may begin a bombing operation. The bomber squadrons may be grouped up into one or more wings consisting of two or more squadrons, or may operate as independent squadrons, in any combination, as desired. Upon launch and again at the beginning of their parent vessel's subsequent Strategic Turns, the bomber wings may move freely a number of VUs up to the speed of the slowest squadron in the unit. They may continue to operate away from their carrier for no more than six Strategic Turns (four if the wings include fighters), as fuel and life support supplies begin to run low and the bombers are forced to return to their carrier. Upon moving within 1VU of an enemy vessel, the bombers may commence an attack run, closing quickly upon their target to deliver their payload before retreating back to the carrier.\n\nMake a Challenging (+0) Command+Craft Rating Test (this will either be from a character aboard the carrier, or from a character leading the bombers personally), gaining a +5 bonus for every squadron of friendly bombers after the first. A successful test causes a single hit upon the enemy vessel, with an additional hit for every degree of success. This is up to a maximum of three hits, plus one additional maximum hit for every additional bomber squadron after the first. If the bombing run scores at least four degrees of success, the target also suffers a Critical Hit. Roll 1d5 on the Critical Hit chart and apply the result.\n\nEach hit deals 1d10+4 damage. Add together the damage rolled from each hit, and then subtract from that the armour value of the target ship. Bomber attacks ignore void shields. If, for any reason, the target ship has multiple armour values (such as from the Armoured Prow Component), then the lowest armour value is always used. The final total is the number of points of Hull Integrity the target ship loses.\n\nAfter delivering their payload, the bombers withdraw to their carrier to refuel and rearm.\n\n## Torpedo bombers\n\nCertain rare vessels have been known to carry a variant of normal bombers known collectively as torpedo bombers. Each torpedo bomber forgoes its normal payload in favour of a single comparatively small torpedo, which it can launch at any point. While seldom as destructive as a true bombing run, the technique can allow for torpedo attacks to come from an unexpected angle.\n\nInstead of performing bombing runs, Torpedo Bombers may, at the start of any turn instead of their normal movement, launch their torpedoes. The torpedoes immediately move directly forwards in whatever direction the bombers were facing, following all the normal rules for torpedoes. Each torpedo bomber can launch one torpedo. A squadron of torpedo bombers is comprised of three torpedo bombers.\n\nTorpedo bombers can launch any type of torpedo, however any torpedo launched from a torpedo bomber has its range halved, as the bombers cannot haul torpedoes with a full load of fuel. In addition, due to their rarity, Acquisition Tests to acquire bombers with torpedo fittings suffer a -5 penalty in addition to any other modifiers. There is also the matter of storing the torpedoes if the starship does not have the stowage that comes with a Torpedo Tube Component. A typical Munitorium can store nine torpedoes on a ship of light cruiser size or larger, or six on a smaller vessel. One could also store a comparable number in a cargo hold, but the lack of safe storage means the torpedoes have a 25% chance of detonating should that Component become damaged or destroyed (see page 37 for rules on what this might do to a vessel).\n\n## Assault Boat Operations\n\nBlunt and unsubtle-looking craft, assault boats are a form of heavily-armoured shuttle designed to carry large boarding parties onto enemy ships. Assault boat prows are typically fitted with an array of high-energy cutting devices, explosive charges, mechanical drills, claws and other tools for breaching the hull of an enemy vessel, behind which are bulky blast doors leading into a transport compartment filled with eager armsmen.\n\nAs an Extended Action, any number of assault boat squadrons currently ready within a ship's launch bays may begin an assault operation. The assault boat squadrons may be grouped up into one or more wings consisting of two or more squadrons, or may operate as independent squadrons, in any combination, as desired. Upon launch and again at the beginning of their parent vessel's subsequent Strategic Turns, the assault boat wings may move freely a number of VUs up to the speed of the slowest squadron in the unit. They may continue to remain away from their carrier in this manner for no more than four turns, as fuel and life support supplies begin to run low and the assault boats are forced to return to their carrier. Upon moving within 1VU of an enemy vessel, the assault boats may commence an attack run, closing quickly upon their target to deliver their payload before retreating back to the carrier.\n\nMake a Challenging (+0) Command+Craft Rating Test (this will either be from a character aboard the carrier, or from a character leading the assault boats personally), gaining a +5 bonus for every squadron of friendly bombers after the first. A successful test means that a single assault boat squadron has reached the ship and breached the hull, with an additional assault boat landing for every degree of success, up to a maximum equal to the number of assault boat squadrons attacking that survived any defensive fire. The character leading the boarding parties (if an Explorer is piloting an assault boat, he may not also lead the boarding parties) then begins a Hit and Run Action against the target, ignoring the Operate (Aeronautica) Test and gaining a +10 for every assault boat squadron that successfully landed.\n\nAfter delivering their payload, the assault boats withdraw to their carrier with any survivors by the shortest expedient route.\n","excerpt":"# Attack Craft  Often ill-favoured by the command staff of Battlefleet Calixis due to a preference for \"true\" warships, carrier vessels like the Dictator-class cruiser are nonetheless a valuable strategic asset for the Imperial Navy, simply due to their versatility. The average launch bay on a cruiser-few smaller vessels can spare the internal volume needed to support attack craft operations-carries an assortment of craft, from an abundance of cargo lighters and personnel shuttles, to larger troop dropships, atmospheric craft (sometimes in storage containers, sometimes with limited void-capability for orbital deployment) to anti-ship heavy bombers, assault boats and fighters. This sheer abundance of different craft allows carriers to undertake a wide variety of missions either directly or in support of other vessels."},{"srdPath":"starships/combat/overview","title":"Starship Combat","content":"# Starship Combat\n\nSpace combat is a terrifying experience. Massive batteries of macro-weaponry fling shells and munitions, torpedoes the size of hab-blocks streak through the void, and ships are consumed by fi e or explode with the fury of a nova. If a void shield fails or armour plating buckles, thousands of lives can be snuffed out in an instant. However, there will come times when a Rogue Trader has little choice but to run out his guns and prepare for battle. After all, they are not the only ones who desire the galaxy's wealth, and to take it for themselves, Rogue Traders must be prepared to fight for it.\n\n## Rounds, Turns, and Time - in Space \n\nSpace combat is handled in a similar manner to normal combat. Space travel is normally handled in Narrative Time. Other situations, such as dodging a hurtling asteroid at the last moment, are best broken up by the GM into the standard Turns and Rounds. However, certain situations- particularly ship-to-ship combat-require a slight adjustment to the Structured Time approach.\n\nSpace warfare is very different from the close-in, personal fighting of hand-to-hand combat and short ranged firefight. Great warships can spend days chasing down their opponents and hours manoeuvring into position for single devastating volleys from their broadsides. Therefore, the GM should break up space combat into Strategic Rounds and Strategic Turns. While these function mechanically in the same fashion as the Rounds and Turns of Structured Time, the interval of time they represent is longer. A Strategic Round lasts for roughly thirty minutes, during which, each ship involved in the scene takes a Strategic Turn. Each Strategic Turn overlaps, so the actions of each ship occur almost simultaneously. However, in game terms, each ship acts in a sequence determined by the combat's Initiative Order (see below).\n\nA Strategic Round is completed when every participant in the combat has completed their Strategic Turn.\n\n### Space Combat Overview \n\nWhen a Round of space combat begins, the GM and players follow certain steps to determine what happens. These steps are similar to those followed when regular combat begins, and the differences are specified below. Surprise It is certainly possible for one ship to surprise another in combat. Since Strategic Rounds last a half hour, it is highly unlikely that even a surprised crew will be completely unable to react. However, the attacker may be able to land a few crippling blows as the defender's crew struggles to prepare their ship for combat. See the sidebar for the effects of surprise.\n\n#### Initiative \n\nAt the beginning of the combat, the captain of each ship rolls 1d10 and adds his ship's Detection bonus (the tens digit in its Detection characteristic). Bonuses that apply to a character's Initiative in Structured Time (regular combat) do not apply, otherwise Initiative in space combat works the same as regular combat.\n\n#### Taking Turns \n\nStarting with the ship with the highest Initiative roll, each ship takes a Strategic Turn, during which it will make a Movement and Shooting Action. Players may take Extended Actions as well.\n\n#### The End of the Round \n\nOnce every ship has taken its Strategic Turn, the Strategic Round ends. Continue to play successive Rounds until the GM determines the combat is over.\n\n### Surprise \n\nSurprise affects the first Strategic Round in space combat. As in regular combat, the GM must ultimately determine which vessels are Surprised, based on the actions of the players and NPCs and the environment their ships are operating in. Here are some guidelines to take into account.\n\n-   Hidden vessels: The fury of a running plasma drive is almost impossible to hide in open space. However, a canny captain may use a convenient asteroid field, nebula, or even planet to mask his engine signatures. Alternatively, ships can go on Silent Running to lurk in the cold darkness of space while his opponents fly right to them. A proper Scrutiny+Detection Test with the ship's detection equipment may warn of the danger.\n-   Ambush and treachery: In some situations, a friend may turn to foe in an instant. Such situations are highly dangerous if the ambusher is in close formation with his target. He may not even have to manoeuvre to place his target squarely within his sights. Although it is up to the GM, a skilled scanner operator may detect the last-minute powering up of the weapons with a Challenging (+0) Scrutiny+Detection Test.\n-   Extenuating circumstances: Ships' scanners and detection equipment are fickle devices, and easily fooled by powerful celestial phenomena such as solar flares, magnetic storms, and unpredictable gravity fluctuations. The interference may be powerful enough to mask the approach of attackers.\n\nUsing these guidelines (and any others he deems necessary), the GM determines at the beginning of combat if anyone is Surprised. Any attackers firing on Surprised ships gain a +20 bonus to attack rolls against them during the first Round of combat.\n\n## Actions \n\nDuring each Strategic Round, each ship receives one Strategic Turn. Like regular combat, each ship can perform Actions during this turn. The Actions a ship performs fall into two categories: Manoeuvre Actions and Shooting Actions. Each ship must make one Manoeuvre Action and may make one Shooting Action during their turn. Each of these Actions must be performed by a separate Explorer. Any Explorers who did not perform either Action may perform an Extended Action instead.\n\nIndividual characters will take their turns during their ship's Strategic Turn. They do not roll for initiative separately. At the beginning of each ship's turn, the players (or the GM, if it an NPC's ship) determine which Shooting Action, Manoeuvre Action, and Extended Actions the players will perform, and in which order. All Actions (and the order they are performed in) must be determined at the beginning of the starship's Turn.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, players must perform the ship\\'s Manoeuvre Action before its Shooting Action, and may perform Extended Actions anywhere in this order that they wish (before a Manoeuvre or Shooting Action to grant it a bonus, for instance, or afterward to compensate for its consequences).\n\nNote: Actions often require a Combined Skill Test, such as a Operate (Voidship) + Manoeuvrability Test. After all, even an ace pilot must rely to an extent on his equipment. To make these tests, add the ship's ability, such as Manoeuvrability, to the character's Skill, such as Operate (Voidship). Then perform the test using the combined value.\n\n### NPC Actions \n\nIt is entirely possible that the players will want to perform more actions than there are players in a group. In this case, the GM should remember that the players' characters command a ship with thousands of crewmembers. If the players want to have a crewmember perform any of the following Actions, they can. If they do so, the GM will roll to see if the Action is successful, starship\\'s Crew Rating.\n\nHowever, the GM should be careful not to let the players delegate too many tasks to their NPCs. In general, the GM should only allow the NPCs aboard a vessel to perform three Actions per Strategic Round. Alternatively, the GM can allow the NPCs aboard a vessel to perform a number of Actions per Strategic Round equal to the tens column of the NPC crew's Skill rating. So, for example, a Competent crew could perform three Actions, while a Veteran crew could perform five. Either option is valid, and the GM should select one to use when setting up his game.\n\nPlayers should keep in mind their NPC crewmembers are rarely as skilled as they are. Also, GMs should use common sense when dealing with the delegation of tasks to NPCs, and are encouraged to require the Explorers to perform certain, more important, actions personally. The idea is to keep the players involved in a combat, and not have it come down to a series of NPC activities and dice roles.\n\n### Manoeuvre Actions \n\nDuring space combat, opposing ships can be less than a hundred metres apart, or have many thousands of kilometres between them. The latter is far more likely-it is rare that a gunner on a ship can see his target with an unaided eye.\n\nIn space combat, the distance from one ship to another, or how far a ship moves in a Strategic Turn, is measured in void units (VUs). The distance represented by a single VU is deliberately abstract and left open to some interpretation due to space's vast size. However, a good guideline is a single VU equals roughly 10,000 kilometres. Since even a single VU represents a vast distance, it is possible for two ships to be within one VU of each other. At that range, space combat becomes truly brutal, with ramming attempts and even boarding actions.\n\nBasic space combat begins with all ships involved at a distance from each other determined by the scenario and the GM. There may be other phenomena in the combat as well, a nearby planet, perhaps, or even a vast asteroid field.\n\nWhen beginning combat, the GM and players should determine the direction each starship is facing. A starship's facing is the direction it will travel when moving directly forward.\n\nWhen a starship takes its Manoeuvre Action, it chooses to move directly forward a number of VUs equal to its Speed value or half its Speed value. This is the default action of a starship- since starships are huge vessels with immense momentum, players do not have the option of simply not moving their ship. Once the starship has moved forward by its Speed value or half its Speed value, it may turn. Transports, raiders, frigates, and other ships of equivalent size (i.e., Hull Integrity and Available Space) can turn up to 90 degrees to the left or right (or port and starboard). Unless otherwise stated, all other ships may turn up to 45 degrees instead.\n\nEither version of this Manoeuvre (moving at half or full Speed value) is considered the starship's default Manoeuvre, and does not require any Skill Tests to perform. However, a skilled pilot can use more advanced Manoeuvre Actions to modify this Manoeuvre. Each Manoeuvre modifies (but does not replace) the basic Manoeuvre action mentioned above, and only one Manoeuvre may be selected per Turn. Unless specified otherwise, a starship's turn may never be more than 90 degrees. If a starship ever fails its Test while performing a Manoeuvre, it simply makes either version of its default Manoeuvre (it moves forward either half its Speed value or its full Speed value, then may turn).\n\n#### Silent Running \n\nA ship may be attempt to avoid notice by going on silent running, shutting down non-essential systems and attempting to drift, unnoticed, past its opposition. When on silent running, a ship makes Manoeuvre Actions as normal, except the starship's Speed value is halved, and the difficulty of all related Skill Tests increases by one step. The default Manoeuvre Action requires an Ordinary (+10) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test. If the helmsman fails these tests, his ship performs the Manoeuvre as normal, but some power surge or engine flare betrays their presence, and any ships within sensor range become aware of them. Enemy ships may detect a ship on silent running by using the Active Augury Extended Action. Needless to say, if the ship fires any weapons, it is immediately detected as well.\n\n### Shooting Actions \n\nAfter completing its Manoeuvre Action, a ship has the option of firing its weapons. Each Weapon Component may be fired once per Strategic Turn, and all Weapon Components must be fired at once, although they may be fired at different targets. A Weapon Component may only be fired at a target within its firing arc. Firing weapons and resolving damage is covered later in this document.\n\n### Extended Actions \n\nExtended Actions are only available to characters who have not taken part in Manoeuvre or Shooting Actions this turn. They represent characters doing other activities to aid the ship, such as making repairs, caring for the wounded, and even raiding enemy vessels. Note: The modifiers listed for Skill Tests may be modified at the GM's discretion. Although each player may only perform one Extended Action per Strategic Turn, it may or may not take the entire 30 minutes, depending on the action.\n\n### Ramming and Boarding Actions\n\nThere are desperate times in the fury of space combat when a captain's only course of action is to use his own starship as a weapon. If a starship ends its Manoeuvre Action within one VU of an enemy vessel and its bow is facing said vessel, the starship may give up its Shooting Action this turn and ram the ship instead. The helmsman must make a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship) + Manoeuvrability Test. If he succeeds, the ship crashes into its target, doing damage based on its hull size - 1d5 for transports and raiders, 1d10 for frigates, 2d5 for light cruisers, and 2d10 for cruisers. The ship adds the die roll to its prow armour value for total damage inflicted. This damage ignores void shields. The ramming ship then takes damage equal to the defending ship's Armour plus 1d5 to their prow armour, also ignoring void shields.\n\nHowever, sometimes, the best course of action is to crash into the enemy, send across parties of armsmen and ratings, and take their ship by storm. This is called a boarding action.\n\nIf a starship ends its Manoeuvre Action within 1 VU of its target, it may give up its shooting action to Board the target. The helmsman must make a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship)+ Manoeuvrability Test. If he succeeds, the two ships crash together and the boarding action begins. While two ships are involved in a boarding action, neither of them can take Manoeuvre or Shooting Actions (meaning the two ships remain stationary), although individual characters may still take Extended Actions. The ships are locked together, and the only way a ship can break free is by making a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship)+ Manoeuvrability Test at the beginning of its turn. If a ship attempts to break free and fails, however, it will suffer a -20 to the subsequent opposed Command Test (see below).\n\nThe two ships take their Strategic Turns simultaneously, dropping to last in the initiative order. During their turns, two characters, one from each ship (whoever is leading the ship's warriors), make an opposed Command Test. The ship with the larger Crew Population value will receive a +10 bonus to its character's Command Test for every full 10 points difference in Crew Population between the two ships. The ship with the higher remaining Hull Integrity provides a +10 bonus to its character's Command Test for every full 10 points difference in Crew Population between the two ships. Each ship's turret rating also provides a bonus.\n\nFor each degree the winner wins by, he may choose to inflict one of the following options on his opponent. The loser may either suffer 1d5 Crew Population and 1d5 Morale damage (representing the crew cutting through the enemy), or 1 point of Hull Integrity damage (representing the crew setting charges and doing as much damage as possible). Damage to Hull Integrity will also result in damage to Crew Population and Morale as normal.\n\nThe ship that has lost the opposed Command Test must then roll a d100 and compare it to their current Morale. If they roll an equal or lower number than their Morale, their crew continues to fight. During the next Strategic Turn, both ships will make opposed Command Tests again. If, however, the losing ship rolls higher than their current Morale, their crew routes and surrenders to their captors. If the ship is an NPC vessel, it surrenders. If it is the Explorers' vessel, the characters face a grim choice-surrender to their foes, or try and flee as best they can\\...\n\n## Destroying Ships \n\nMost of the Critical Hit results will not destroy a ship outright. Rather, they will instead damage it in some way. This is indicative of the nature of space combat-ships are rarely completely destroyed, and often even badly damaged hulks can be dragged back to port for salvage and refit. However, a GM should never feel constrained by the Critical Hit chart when dealing with an NPC vessel. If he prefers a simpler space combat, he can modify the Critical Hit Chart in the following manner. When the starship is reduced to zero Hull Integrity, the Critical Hit Chart changes so the 1-9 results are the enemy vessel drifting away as a shattered, completely worthless hulk, and the 10-12 results are the ship violently exploding. If a 10-12 critical result is rolled, treat the ship as if it suffered a Catastrophic Overload. This means an NPC vessel will suffer the effects of Critical Hits as normal while its Hull Integrity is above zero. Once it hits zero, any Critical Hit-whether from doing damage past Hull Integrity or from a Weapon Component's Crit Rating-will destroy the vessel. Of course, this modification means the players will have no enemy ship to board and explore\\...\n\n## Damage and Defences \n\nThere are two principle defences for starships in the 41st millennium, void shields and armour.\n\nVoid Shields create an invisible energy barrier around a starship. Miracles of lost technology, these barriers serve two purposes. First, they brush aside swaths of dust and detritus adrift in the void that would otherwise scar, befoul, and even destroy a starship (though they offer little protection against especially large objects like asteroids). Their second purpose is to absorb the terrific energies of incoming fire. If it absorbs too much energy too quickly, however, the void shield collapses, and must bleed off the accumulated energy before it can be raised again.\n\nArmour can take many forms, but is often layers of adamantine and ceramite many metres thick, covering the outer hull of the vessel.\n\n### Void Shields\n\nVoid shields function by absorbing incoming hits before they can be resolved against their target. Whenever a ship chooses to fire on another ship during its turn, the target ship's void shields (assuming it has any!) will cancel a number of incoming hits equal to the strength of the shields. In other words, if a ship has one void shield, after an attacker determines the total number of hits going against the ship, that number of hits is reduced by one. It does not matter if the hits are from lances or macrobatteries.\n\nHowever, void shields can be overloaded. Once they have reduced their strength in hits, they overload and shut down. Any remaining hits in that salvo will hit the target, and any further shots fired against the target by the attacking ship will also hit the target unimpeded by void shields.\n\nIf the attacker combines the damage of multiple macrobatteries against the defending ship, the attacker chooses which hits are discarded by the void shields. This represents the attacker timing his salvos to overwhelm the enemy's shields with his lighter weaponry.\n\nIt is important to note that void shields reduce hits from all ships firing on them. If one attacker fires on a ship, the ship's void shields reduce the hits as usual. Even if they overload and another attacker fires on the ship in the same Strategic Round, the void shields will be restored in time to protect against that attacker's fire as well.\n\n### Armour\n\nOnce void shields have been taken into account, and the damage for the remaining hits is rolled and added together, it is compared to the target's Armour. The Armour value is subtracted from the damage total. If the result is zero or less, the target's Armour has successfully protected the vessel. If the result is more than zero, the target loses that many points of Hull Integrity.\n\n### Hull Integrity\n\nHull Integrity can be considered similar to a ship's Wounds. It is a measure of how tough the vessel is, and how much damage it can take before being blown open. For every point of Hull Integrity a ship loses, it loses 1 Crew Population and 1 Morale as well.\n\n### Turrets \n\nThe hull of a starship is often covered with short-range, rapid-firing weapons. These could be rapid-cycling multi-lasers, quad-barrelled auto-cannon, or even vulcan megabolters. All are collectively referred to as turrets and are designed to shoot down torpedoes and assault craft, as well as help defend the ship in the event of a boarding action. If a starship has defence turrets, it has a turret rating.\n\nThe turret rating does not correspond to the actual number of turrets-a starship with scores of defence turrets might only have a turret rating of 1. For each point of a starship's turret rating, the ship imposes a -10 penalty on the Operate tests of any Hit and Run Attacks directed against it. Additionally, each point of a starship's turret rating adds +10 to its side's Command Test during a boarding action.\n\nWhile Void Shields are a more than adequate defence against macrocannon shells and lance beams, they are useless against slower-moving attacks such as torpedo salvoes and bombers. Consequently, most vessels possess a number of small, lightweight defensive weapons, collectively known as turrets, incapable of harming a full starship but more than able to destroy enemy torpedoes and attack craft.\n\nA ship's turrets work identically whether defending against torpedoes or attack craft. Before the attacker rolls to score hits the defending vessel may attempt a Ballistic Skill Test using the crew's Skill Rating, with a +5 bonus for every point of Turret Rating the vessel has (the ship must have a Turret rating of at least 1 to attempt this). If successful, then the turrets hit once, plus one additional hit for every two degrees of success, with each hit shooting down a single torpedo or attack craft squadron, reducing the number of torpedoes in the salvo or attack craft squadron in the wave before the attack roll is made. Torpedoes shot down are destroyed harmlessly. Attack craft shot down may have merely been disabled or driven off instead of destroyed, but, one way or another, can no longer attack.\n\n## Crippled Ships \n\nWhen a ship reaches 0 Hull Integrity, it becomes Crippled. Apply a -10 penalty to its Manoeuvrability and Detection, and reduce its Speed to half. In addition, reduce the strength of all weapon Components by half (round up). A ship will remain Crippled (and continue to suffer these effects) until it has regained at least 1 Hull Integrity.\n\nWhen a Crippled ship takes damage past its Armour, it takes a Critical Hit. Compare the value of the damage that exceeded the Armour to the Critical Hit chart. The ship suffers this Critical Hit result.\n\n### Critical Hits \n\nOftentimes, an especially lucky or well placed blow will do more than boil off armour or consign some unlucky pressmen to the void. Shells and beams may tear deep into a starship's gut, ripping out her insides, crippling her systems, and leaving her bleeding air.\n\nThe Critical Hit chart for ships should be used when a weapon's attack roll has met its Crit Rating, or when a crippled ship takes damage. Some Critical Hits require an attacker to know about Components on the target ship. The attacker can know what Components their target has in one of two ways. The first is through using Active Augury to scan the enemy vessel. The second is that if the enemy vessel uses a Component to attack or otherwise effect the attacker, the attacker obviously knows of its existence and can target it with a Critical Hit.\n\n#### Critical Hit Chart\n| Damage | Result | Effect |\n|---|---|---|\n| **1** | *Holed* | A lucky hit has wrenched open the ship's hull, exposing it to space. The attacker selects one Component (only choosing ones he knows of) that is not the bridge or plasma/warp drives. Emergency bulkheads slam into place to seal off the compartments, but this Component is depressurized.  |\n| **2** | *Internal Damage* | The force of the hit ruptures bulkheads and smashes machinery. The attacker selects one Component (only choosing ones he knows of) that is not the bridge or plasma/warp drives. This Component is damaged.  |\n| **3** | *Sensors damaged* | The ship's auspex arrays have been knocked out, leaving the vessel blind. Until the damage is repaired, all shooting tests suffer a –30 to hit, and all sensory tests to detect anything beyond the ship's immediate engagement range automatically fail. Additionally, as the arrays are located outside the hull, any repairs must be attempted in the void.  |\n| **4** | *Thrusters damaged* | The ship's manoeuvring thrusters are smashed, venting randomly and leaking fuel. Roll 1d10. On a 1-7, the ship can still manoeuvre, albeit slowly. Reduce the ship's Manoeuvrability bonus by –20. On an 8–10, the thrusters are completely damaged. The ship cannot turn. This damage can be repaired.  |\n| **5** | *Fire!* | Alarms scream through the hull as hungry flames oar though passageways and compartments. The blaze must be contained before it devours the entire ship! The attacker selects one Component (only choosing ones he knows of) that is not the bridge or plasma/warp drive—this Component is now on fire. The fire follows all the rules for shipboard fires.  |\n| **6** | *Engines Crippled* | Something pierces the immense drive tubes in the ship's stern, bleeding plasma into the void and leaving the vessel drifting in space. Roll 1d10. on a 1-7, the plasma drives are still usable, though heavily damaged. Reduce the ship's Speed by half. On an 8–10, the drives are completely wrecked. Reduce the ship's Speed to 1. This damage can be repaired.  |\n| **7** | *Surly Techsprites* | Something has jarred and shocked the ship's machine spirits, awakening their anger. Massive electrical surges knock out systems across the ship. Roll 1d10 for every Component. On a 4 or higher, the Component now counts as unpowered. Each Component must be repaired individually before it can receive power again. Morale takes 1d5 damage from the spooky atmosphere.  |\n| **8** | *Decapitation* | A lucky hit strikes the ship's bridge, sending shrapnel scything across the compartment and opening it to space! All crewmembers on the bridge must make a Dodge reaction or be hit by shrapnel doing 2d10 Explosive damage. If the damage result is 12 or higher, the bridge Component is also depressurized. If the damage result is 16 or higher, the Component is damaged.  |\n| **9–10** | *Hull Breach* | The hull of the ship is ripped asunder by tremendous force, opening compartments to the void and doing massive structural damage. The attacker selects 1d5 Components (only choosing ones he knows of, and not including the bridge). Roll a d10 for each on a 1-7 the Component is damaged and depressurized. On an 8–10 the Component is destroyed, and all crew inside are killed. Instead of rolling for Crew Population and Morale damage separately, the ship reduces both of its current values by half.  |\n| **11** | *Catastrophic Damage* | A succession of powerful blows and explosions rip through the ship, causing horrendous damage. Roll 1d10. On a 1-7, the ship is hulked. On a 8-9, the ship's plasma drive explodes. On a 10, the ship's warp drive explodes instead (if the ship does not have a warp drive, it suffers a plasma drive explosion).  |\n| **-** | *Space Hulk* | Catastrophic damage leaves the ship a drifting, smouldering wreck. Uncontrolled fires burn in some compartments, others are open to space, and the rest are choked with the dead and dying. Roll 1d10 for each Component. On a 1–2, it is miraculously untouched, but is unpowered. On a 3-7, it is depressurized and damaged. On a 9–10, it is completely destroyed, and all crew inside are killed. Reduce Crew Population to 1d10.  |\n| **-** | *Plasma Drive Explosion* | The starship's plasma drive explodes in a single, cataclysmic explosion. All starships within 1d10 VUs of the stricken craft must make a Hard (–20) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test or be struck by the flaming debris of the destroyed vessel. Treat this as 1d5 macrobattery hits doing 1d10+4 damage each, that void shields and armour will protect against normally.  |\n| **-** | *Warp Drive Explosion* | The starship's warp drive overloads and explodes, rending a seething hole in space, a maelstrom into the realm of chaos. Any starship within 2d10 VUs of the stricken craft must make a Hard (–20) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test or be struck by the chaos-storm, taking the equivalent of one lance strike doing 1d10 damage that void shields will not protect against. Additionally, every starship within 1d5 VUs of the stricken vessel must make a second Challenging (+0) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test, or be sucked into the rift. What happens next is up to the GM, but should be suitably horrible. Mass possessions and manifesting daemons are the norm, while the crew frantically tries to activate the Geller Field. The survival of those onboard the ship should by no means be guaranteed. |\n","excerpt":"# Starship Combat  Space combat is a terrifying experience.

Particularly in the case of raiders and frigates, squadrons of lightly-armed craft can often overwhelm larger, more powerful vessels together when they may not be able to do so alone. In larger battles, even cruisers will form into line squadrons, combining their considerable firepower into a single, devastating force. A group of two or more vessels may be formed into a squadron, at which point they will fight as a single entity. This requires a number of changes to the way the vessels act. Below are a series of rules and guidelines for grouping vessels into squadrons.\n\n## Squadron Composition \n\nSquadrons are composed of two or more vessels of similar size. Under normal circumstances, only vessels of the same hull type can be grouped into a squadron. In some cases, however, it may be desirable to group frigates and raiders into the same squadron, or to group cruisers and battlecruisers or grand cruisers. In broad terms, the different tendencies towards speed, structure and armament of a given hull type may make combining different hull types difficult in practice, particularly when the hulls are very different. Beyond that, the way that squadrons carry out actions means that wildly different armament can cause problems as well - a squadron with only one torpedo-armed vessel will not fully benefit from spending actions to reload those torpedoes, as the action is wasted for every vessel but the torpedo-armed one. Typically, squadrons may be compiled of transports, raiders and frigates, light cruisers, cruisers, and battlecruisers, or grand cruisers. However, at the GM's discretion, different hull types can be mixed in squadrons.\n\n## Squadron Formation \n\nRegular communication is required between vessels in a squadron, using vox and astrotelepathy to ensure that every vessel knows what it's meant to be doing at any given moment. The squadron's commander must give orders to every vessel under his command, and long distances hinder the necessary swiftness of communication. Every vessel in the squadron must remain within 3VU of at least one other vessel in the squadron. The entire squadron must form a single unbroken \"chain,\" with no gap between vessels of greater than 3 VU. If, for any reason, the squadron formation is broken, the squadron's next Manoeuvre Action must involve bringing the squadron back into formation-if it wants to remain operational as a squadron. Squadrons cannot operate without a continuous, short line of communication, and are under standing orders to attempt to regroup when those lines are broken.\n\n## Squadron Crew And Orders \n\nSquadrons move and fight as a single entity, moving in formation and firing at the same targets. A squadron has a single Crew Rating, which applies to every ship within the squadron. If multiple ships have different Crew Ratings, use the Crew Rating of the lowest ship in the squadron. At the start of the combat, roll 1d10 and add the highest Detection Bonus (the tens digit of the Detection characteristic) of the ships in the squadron. This is the squadron's Initiative. During each Strategic Round, each squadron must perform one Manoeuvre Action, and may perform one Shooting Action, and it may perform a number of Extended Actions as deemed appropriate by the GM. The Manoeuvre performed by the squadron must be the same for every ship-they must all move the same distance and turn in the same direction. Should, at any point, a test be called for to successfully perform a Manoeuvre Action, then a single test is made, based on the squadron's Crew Rating, and the lowest Manoeuvrability of the ships in the squadron. Resolving a squadron's Shooting Action is dealt with separately below. Extended Actions are likewise performed by the squadron as a whole, using a single test to resolve the success or failure of the action.\n\n## Shooting At Squadrons \n\nShooting at squadrons must be resolved in a slightly different way than firing at individual vessels. When firing at a squadron, the primary target will always be the vessel in the squadron that is closest to the firing ship. When firing a weapon, the first hit scored must be against the primary target. Any additional hits scored may be allocated against any other vessel in the squadron, so long as at least half of the total hits scored by that Weapon Component are allocated to the primary target. With hits scored from macrobatteries, the damage rolls are added together as usual after being allocated to a target vessel, with all the hits allocated to a single vessel being totaled. With hits scored from lances, the damage rolls are resolved individually as normal. Due to the way torpedoes, attack craft, and nova cannons attack-relying on actual physical location-all torpedoes, attack craft and nova cannons will attack whichever vessel they pass within range of, regardless of whether or not they are part of a squadron. Ships suffer damage and critical hits individually, but damage to Crew Population and Morale are resolved collectively for the entire squadron.\n\n## Squadron Shooting: Massed Fire \n\nSquadrons fire in a different manner than lone ships, representing their ability to fill space with shots. This ability is called Massed Fire. When a squadron performs Massed Fire, select any number of either macrobatteries or lances; the two may not be combined for this purpose. Then select a single one of those Components. Roll to hit with that Component as normal. Every additional Component after the first grants an additional +10 to hit and +1 to the Strength of the Component for that shot only (effectively increasing the number of maximum shots by one). The damage, range and Crit Rating are all determined by the Component for which the attack roll is being made- however, all Weapon Components being used must be in range of the target. In addition, as only a single attack roll is being made only one Critical Hit can be scored. Squadrons can combine macrobatteries or lances into multiple groups for purposes of Massed Fire-for example, a squadron with eight macrobatteries could fire make one Massed Fire with all eight weapons, two with four each, or any other combination. This is intended to speed up combat involving squadrons of NPC starships, as well as give smaller ships an ability to work together to take out larger vessels.\n","excerpt":"# Squadrons   Starships of all species and factions operate in close formation for mutual benefit.

Perhaps a smuggler wishes to run a naval blockade, or a privateer is chasing a valuable prize. Perhaps a ship simply wishes to flee combat, and her captain is doubtful of his chances of successfully disengaging under the enemy's guns. In such situations, players have the options of using the rules for a stern chase-a flight and pursuit between two ships that might last hours, or even days.\n\nStern chases may begin in combat, or outside it. If two ships are not in combat and one ship flees, the other ship may elect to pursue it, beginning a stern chase. If the ships are in combat, a ship may flee the combat if it ends its turn out of range of the guns of any enemy ships. If it does so, it must make a Routine (+10) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test (if it fails, it must remain in the combat and forfeit its next Strategic Turn). Then, all other participants in the combat have the options of pursuing the fleeing vessel. If they chose to do so, they leave the combat on their next Strategic Turn and the stern chase begins.\n\nIf the Explorers are the pursuers, the stern chase is treated in a similar manner to an Exploration Challenge, where the various Explorers will use certain Skill Tests to accumulate a number of successes that must equal a predetermined total for the chase to succeed. The total required for success is based largely off the type of ship the Explorers are pursuing.\n\n-   Transport, Cruiser: 3 Degrees of Success\n-   Light Cruiser, Frigate: 5 Degrees of Success\n-   Raider: 7 Degrees of Success\n-   If the pursued ship's Speed is greater than the pursuer ship's Speed: +2 Degrees of Success\n-   If the pursuer ship's Speed is greater than the pursued ship's Speed: -2 Degrees of Success\n-   If the pursuit takes place in asteroids, nebula, or other obscuring stellar environments: +1 Degree of Success\n\nTo obtain these, the Explorers may test the following Skills as if they were participating in an Exploration Challenge: Tech- Use, Operate (Voidship), Command, and Scrutiny (at the Game Master's discretion other Skills may apply, and the required successes may vary). As with Exploration Challenges, each Explorer may test each of these Skills once, with the default difficulty being Challenging. Success on a Skill Test will reduce the difficulty of subsequent Tests by one step. Degrees of success add an equal number of degrees of success towards successfully completing the stern chase. Conversely, failing a Skill Test makes subsequent Tests one degree more difficult, and each degree of failure removes one degree of success from the total.\n\nIf the Explorers manage to accumulate enough degrees of success to accomplish the stern chase, they bring their quarry to heel. The fleeing ship may surrender, or combat begins as the ship desperately tries to fight its pursuer (follow the rules for space combat). If they fail, their quarry escapes into the vastness of the void.\n\nIt is possible, of course, that the Explorers are the ones being pursued. In that case, the same rules are used (the Explorers must still accumulate a certain amount of successes to successfully escape from their pursuers), with several minor changes. The pursuing ship is now what sets the base number of successes, meaning the Explorers are still the ones attempting the Skill Tests. Also, if the Explorers (the ones being pursued) have a faster ship, they make the Challenge easier, and if they have a slower ship, they make the Challenge more difficult (reverse the penalties and benefits listed above). In addition, if the Explorers use celestial phenomena to their advantage, by fleeing through asteroids or nebulas, they make the Challenge one degree less difficult. If the Explorers succeed, they are the ones who escape into the vastness of space, and if they fail, they are the ones who must make the difficult choice to fight or surrender.\n\nIn either version of the stern chase, the time it takes to accomplish a stern chase roughly equals two hours per degree of success required to successfully accomplish it. This time will be spent whether or not the chase is successful.\n\nRemember, a while a Stern Chase takes place, both ships are visible to each other, but out of range of each other's weapons.\n","excerpt":"# Stern Chase   In some situations, a starship may prefer to flee from opponents, rather than stand and fight.

Lasers, plasma projectors, macrocannons, rocket launchers, terra-watt beam weapons, and more esoteric weaponry such as grav-culverins and gamma emitters, all can be found in a starship's broadside. In game terms, the weapons on starships are Supplemental Components and can be divided into distinct classes; macrobatteries, lances, torpedoes, and nova cannons.\n\nWhen firing a Weapon Component, the character directing the fire makes a Ballistic Skill Test, adding in any appropriate modifier. Characters may direct the fire of more than one Weapon Component (either macro-batteries or lances). This means that one character may direct all of a ship's weapons fire, although different Weapon Components may be fired by different characters if the party chooses. A ship's weapons may be directed against multiple targets. The gunner (or gunners) may select targets for their macrobatteries in turn, unless they are combining the fire of several macrobatteries into a single salvo.\n\nThe range of the shot can affect its accuracy. When firing at a target further away than the range of the weapon (up to the maximum of twice the range), the shot suffers a -10 penalty to the Ballistic Skill Test. However, when firing at a target at half the range, the shot gains a +10 bonus to the Ballistic Skill Test.\n\nWhen firing a weapon, if the character rolls a number of successes equal to the weapon's Crit Rating, the shot has caused a Critical Hit. If the shot does not do any damage to Hull Integrity, inflict 1 automatic point of damage. Then roll 1d5 on the Critical Hit chart and apply the result to the target.\n\nRighteous Fury does not apply to shipboard weapons.\n\n## Firing Arcs\n\nWhether or not a Weapon Component may be fired at a target is determined by its firing arc: front (fore), port (left), starboard (right), and rear (aft). Firing arcs extend in a 90 degree arc from the centre of the vessel. For a visual representation of firing arcs, see Starship Facings. If there is any question between whether a target is in a ship's fore or aft arcs or in its side arcs, the target is considered to be in the side arc. What arcs a weapon my fire in are determined by the location the Weapon Component occupies on a starship: Dorsal, Prow, Port, Starboard, or Keel.\n\n- Dorsal Weapon Components are mounted on the starship's spine or up most decks. They have a wide firing arc, but less weapons can be installed in the relatively limited space. Dorsal weapons may fire to the fore, port, and starboard.\n- Prow Weapon Components are packed into the starship's forward spaces, and are often weapons that must run along much of the length of the hull. Prow weapons on transports, raiders, and frigates may fire to the fore. Prow weapons on light cruisers, cruisers, or larger vessels may fire to the fore, port, and starboard.\n- Port and Starboard Weapon Components are installed in broadsides along the left and right sides of the starship, respectively. Port weapons can fire to the port firing arc, Starboard weapons to the starboard firing arc.\n- Keel Weapon Components are often on long masts or fins below the starship's belly, and are rare on Imperial vessels. Keel weapons may fire in any direction.\n\n# Types of Weapons\n\nMacrobatteries and lances function largely the same, while torpedoes and nova cannons differ in a number of ways.\n\nMacrobatteries form the main armament of most ships, filling the broadsides of vessels with rank upon rank of gigantic weapons. Each requires a crew of dozens, if not hundreds, to operate. Whether they fling kilo-tonne warheads across the void or roast their targets with high-intensity energy, macrobatteries fire in volley. Their salvos are designed to blanket the space around a target, hopefully catching it in a maelstrom of destruction and overwhelm their defences by the sheer number of shots.\n\nLances are rare and potent weapons that fire incredibly high-powered beams of energy capable of burning through the hull of a warship, or cutting a smaller vessel in half. Unlike macrobatteries, lances are often mounted on gigantic turrets where multiple energy projectors focus to create a single, titanic beam.\n\nThe most common form of torpedo is over 60 metres long and contains both a powerful warhead and a short-lived plasma reactor similar to, but less stable than, those used in starships and Titans. Each torpedo is built to accelerate quickly from its launching tube into the void, hurtling in a straight line towards the enemy. While many torpedoes are fired to deter enemy movement and thus may never strike, each individual weapon can do significant damage to a voidship, and thus are feared by many captains.\n\nNova Cannons are a classification of exceptionally powerful weaponry that can only be mounted upon capital ships. Mounted below the heavily armoured prows of Imperial Navy cruisers and battleships, Nova Cannons have few equals in terms of their range or destructive power.\n\n## Macrobatteries And Lances\n\nEach Weapon Component does not necessarily consist of one weapon-a single macrobattery, for example, can have dozens of individual macrocannons arrayed in broadside. Instead of these weapons being treated separately, they are grouped together into a single Weapon Component and treated as a single weapon that can score multiple hits when fired. Although most Weapon Components are classified as macrobatteries or lances, this simply means they follow the same general rules. Specific weapons may have different rules and unique abilities.\n\nEach Weapon Component has the following statistics:\n\n-   Strength: This is the maximum number of hits a macrobattery or lance can land on an enemy ship.\n-   Damage: This is the Damage each hit deals.\n-   Crit Rating: This is the number of successes the shot must have to score a critical hit on the target.\n-   Firing Arc: This determines which direction a starship weapon may be fired in.\n-   Range: This is the range of the weapon. Starship weapons may be fired at targets no farther away than twice the weapon's range.\n\nWhen firing a macrobattery, a successful roll scores one hit, plus an additional hit for each degree of success, to a maximum of the macrobattery's strength. Essentially, a more accurate hit means the character was able to land more shots on the enemy ship. After the ship calculates the amount of hits it has scored, apply the effects of the defender's void shields (see \"Damage and Defences\" below). Once the final number of hits has been determined, roll the weapon's indicated Damage once for each hit, adding the totals together. The final total is the amount of damage dealt to the target.\n\nIf a ship fires multiple macrobatteries at a single target, before rolling to hit and the determining the damage total for each macrobattery, the character directing the firing has the option of adding the totals together and applying the new, larger total to the target ship once, rather than applying each damage result separately. This represents a ship combining its weapon fire into a single, devastating salvo. If he chooses to do this, however, he can only inflict a maximum of one Critical Hit (see below).\n\nLances operate in a similar fashion, but with several distinct differences. When firing a lance, a character makes a Ballistic Skill Test with any appropriate modifiers. A successful roll scores one hit, plus one additional hit for every three degrees of success.\n\nUnlike macrobatteries, the damage from each lance hit is never combined. Each damage total is resolved against the target's defences separately. However, when resolving a lance hit against the target, ignore the target's armour (see \"Damage and Defences,\" below), but not void shields. Lances deal damage directly to Hull Integrity.\n\nIf the damage of two or more macrobatteries is combined into a single salvo, those macrobatteries can only inflict a maximum of one Critical Hit. Even if all of the macrobatteries cause Critical Hits on their Ballistic Skill Tests, only one Critical Hit is applied to the target vessel.\n\nUnless multiple macrobatteries are being combined in a salvo, each Weapon Component should be resolved against the target separately, not simultaneously. (This is important due to the manner in which void shields work.)\n\n## Torpedoes \n\nTorpedoes differ from macrobatteries and lances in a number of ways, particularly in the manner they are fired. For the sake of clarity, the entire process of launching and attacking with torpedoes is described here and does not refer to the rules for shooting macrobatteries and lances above.\n\nIn all cases, torpedo tubes, torpedo launchers and other equivalent Components must always be mounted in either a Prow or Keel weapon location. The forces exerted upon a vessel when firing a salvo of torpedoes are such that only certain mounts can properly contain them. For this reason, on any vessel of Grand Cruiser size and smaller, torpedoes may only fire into the Fore arc, regardless of where the weapon Component is located.\n\nBefore the weapons can be fired, the launchers must be loaded. Normally, it takes a full Strategic Turn in combat to reload any empty tubes on a vessel, at which point the torpedoes may be fired in subsequent turns. However, to reload faster, an Explorer may perform the Rapid Reload Extended action.\n\nAs with macrobatteries and lances, a single torpedo launcher weapon Component actually comprises several launch tubes. This is, as with other weapon Components, denoted as the Component's Strength. All the other properties of an attack using torpedoes are determined by the torpedoes themselves, which have a number of characteristics that define them:\n\n- Speed: The distance in VUs the torpedoes can travel in a single Strategic Turn.\n- Damage: The damage each Torpedo causes on a hit.\n- Critical Hit: The value needed on the damage dice in order to score a critical hit on the target.\n- Range: The number of VUs the torpedoes may travel in total, before the reactor becomes dormant and the Torpedo ineffectual.\n\nWhen firing torpedoes, the launcher's entire Strength value of torpedoes is launched as a single group, referred to as a Salvo. No attack roll is needed at the time of firing, but a single Explorer or NPC must be assigned to launch the Torpedoes, as his skill at readying them for launch will determine their success when they reach their target. This character may still fire other weapons during that Shooting Action as normal- the only difference is that \"firing\" the torpedoes does not require a test until the torpedoes reach their target.\n\nTorpedoes are different than macrobatteries, lances, and Nova Cannons, because the weapons are largely self-contained. Due to this, Explorers cannot perform extended actions to boost the accuracy of torpedoes. No matter how quickly or competently the crew loads a torpedo, it does not affect the weapon's machine spirit's ability to hit a target. In the same way, bonuses from shipboard Components does not boost the Ballistic Skill Test to hit with torpedoes.\n\nUpon firing and at the start of each of the parent ship's subsequent Strategic Turns before any other actions are performed, a Salvo travels directly forward a number of VUs equal to its Speed. The torpedoes continue to travel in this manner until they have travelled a total number of VUs equal to their Range, at which point their reactors' limited fuel is depleted and the torpedoes shut down, cold and inactive.\n\nIf, at any point during movement, a Salvo passes within 1 VU of another vessel (friend or foe; a torpedo's machine spirit is unable and unwilling to make such a distinction), then the character who launched the Torpedoes makes a Challenging (+0) Ballistic Skill+Torpedo Rating Test. On a successful test, one torpedo strikes the target ship, plus an additional torpedo for every Degree of Success. No more torpedoes may hit than the number present in the salvo. Torpedoes are not stopped or hindered by void shields.\n\nNote, if using a grid map, torpedoes hit any target in the same grid square as they are travelling, or the grid squares on either side (effectively giving them a 3 VU coverage).\n\nOnce the total number of torpedo hits has been determined, roll the torpedoes' listed damage value once for each torpedo that hit, comparing each damage result to the target's armour. For every point that exceeds the target's armour, deal one point of damage to the target's hull integrity.\n\nAll torpedoes also have a unique rule: Terminal Penetration (X). When a torpedo rolls damage, re-roll any dice results equal to or lower than the value given in parentheses. The results of the re-roll stand, they are not re-rolled again.\n\nUnlike macrobatteries, the damage from multiple torpedoes in a salvo is not combined then compared to starship armour.\n\nAny torpedoes which are not shot down by turret fire and which do not hit the target vessel continue moving as normal until they either strike a vessel or reach their maximum range.\n\n### Torpedoes and Critical Hits \n\nTorpedoes resolve Critical Hits differently than almost every other attack available to a vessel. This is for one very obvious reason-accuracy. While macrobatteries, lances and attack craft can all guide their attacks to various degrees, the final approach of a torpedo is largely automated and fairly clumsy by comparison. Consequently, the chance of a torpedo scoring a Critical Hit is determined by damage and random chance rather than operator skill.\n\nWhen a torpedo rolls damage, if at least one of the dice values equals or exceeds the value listed in the Crit Rating of the torpedo's profile, the torpedo causes a Critical Hit. If the torpedo has not done damage to Hull Integrity, it does 1 point of damage. Then roll 1d5 on Table Critical Hits to generate the Critical Hit result.\n\n### Short and Wide Salvos \n\nIt is possible to launch torpedoes in smaller salvos than the number of available tubes-whether because the ship does not have enough torpedoes to load all its tubes, or because a canny captain wants to hold some in reserve, ready to fire at a moment's notice.\n\nLaunching a \"short salvo\" does not require any test; the Explorer directing the launch simply announces how many he is launching. However, if in subsequent turns the Explorer wishes to launch more torpedoes than remain in the tubes, he will need to reload first.\n\nLikewise, some canny Explorers may want to launch a wider \"spread\" of torpedoes, saturating a wider area to make the salvo harder to evade. This decreases the chances of multiple strikes, but likewise decreases the chances of enemy ships getting out of the way. If an Explorer wants to fire a \"wide salvo,\" he announces it on firing. These behave in the same way as normal salvos, except that the torpedoes attack any targets passing within two VUs, instead of one (effectively giving them a 5 VU coverage on a grid). However, the Ballistic Skill Test to hit becomes Hard (-20) instead of Challenging (+0), and the maximum number of hits the torpedoes can score is equal to half the salvo's current size. A ship must be able to launch at least two torpedoes to fire a wide salvo.\n\n### Torpedoes Ammunition\n\nUnlike ammunition for personal firearms, every ship has a finite supply of torpedoes. Each Torpedo Tube Component lists how many torpedoes it is able to hold. Once that number of torpedoes has been fired, the ship may not fire more torpedoes until more have been procured. Procuring additional torpedoes requires an Acquisition Test, with all pertinent modifiers applying. Each type of torpedo has a Availability rating, and in addition, if one wishes to purchase multiple torpedoes, scale ratings apply as well. The one exception to this is Craftsmanship. Torpedoes do not have different craftsmanship. However, due to their rarity and the difficulty in producing them outside of a Forge world, all Acquisition Tests to procure torpedoes not made on a Forge world suffer a -10 modifier in addition to any other modifiers.\n\n## Nova Cannons \n\nWhile variation exists, a typical Nova Cannon consists of an array of potent gravimetric impellers designed to accelerate a projectile to a fraction of the speed of light. These projectiles vary more than the nature of the cannons themselves, ranging from sophisticated plasma warheads which burn with the ferocity of a small star for a fraction of a second, to implosive devices which exert destructive gravitational forces upon all those caught within several thousand kilometres of the detonation. In any case, a well-used Nova Cannon is a terrifying thing to face, as much a psychological tool as a weapon. The weapons however are often ill-favoured by the Imperial Navy, with most captains preferring to utilise the more traditional torpedoes. Those few who favour the weapon understand that it is difficult to use and often rendered useless at close ranges.\n\n### Firing the Nova Cannon \n\nNova Cannons are extremely powerful weapons, easily able to wreak vast destruction upon enemy vessels at great range, but are inaccurate and require a stable vessel to fire effectively. Due to the lethal nature of their warheads, nova cannon shells are not armed for a fraction of a second after firing, allowing them to travel many tens of thousands of kilometres through the void before they become truly deadly. For these reasons and several others, nova cannons follow a number of specific rules when firing which do not apply to other weapons.\n\nIf a ship performs a Manoeuvre Action with a total modifier of greater than Challenging, it may not fire its Nova Cannon in the same turn. Similarly, a Crippled ship may not fire its nova cannon. Once a Nova Cannon has fired, its crew must spend the subsequent turn reloading and preparing the weapon for a second firing. This means a Nova Cannon may only fire once every other turn.\n\nWhen firing a Nova Cannon, nominate a single point anywhere within the weapon's maximum range that is more than 6 Void Units from the ship and in the vessel's Fore firing arc. That is the target point. The difficulty of targeting with a nova cannon is such that all attack rolls with the weapon suffer an additional -20 penalty. Otherwise, the attack roll is resolved normally using a character's Ballistic Skill during a Shooting Action, including the normal modifiers for range.\n\nA successful attack roll means that the shot was on target and detonates at the desired point. A failed attack roll means that the shot was not on target and has instead detonated too soon or too late. However, such is the power of these weapons that even an inaccurate shot may still damage the enemy. For every degree by which the attack roll failed, the target point moves 1VU away from the firing ship if the attack roll was an even number (i.e. a number ending in 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8), or 1VU towards the firing ship if the attack roll was an odd number (i.e. a number ending in 1, 3, 5, 7 or 9).\n\nIn either case, any vessel within 1 VU of the target point will be hit by the shell's detonation, causing 1d5 hits (which can be negated by void shields as normal) dealing the weapon's normal damage. Damage from a Nova Cannon shell ignores armour. Any damage dice that roll a 10 cause one Critical Hit. If a Critical Hit is scored, then roll 1d5 on the Critical Hit chart and apply the results as normal. Such is the power of the Nova Cannon that it may cause multiple Critical Hits in this way, rather than a maximum of one as is the case for most weapons.\n\nAn accurate Nova Cannon shell can potentially deal far more damage. If the attack roll succeeds by two or more degrees, then a single vessel within 1 VU of the target point (chosen by the firer) suffers 1d5+2 hits instead of 1d5. As noted above, damage dice rolling natural 10s cause Critical Hits.\n\n### Nova Cannon Ammunition \n\nLike torpedoes, nova cannon shells are difficult to manufacture, and unless one is serving in the Imperial Navy, even more difficult to procure. A Nova Cannon Component comes with a finite supply of warheads (default storage of 20, although different Components may store different amounts). Once those warheads are exhausted, procuring more requires an Acquisition Test, with all pertinent modifiers applying. Nova cannon shells have an availability of Extremely Rare. However, due to their rarity and the difficulty in producing them outside of a Forge world, all Acquisition Tests to procure Nova Cannon shells not made on a Forge world suffer a -10 modifier in addition to any other modifiers.\n","excerpt":"# Firing Starship Weapons  Starship weapons in the 41st millennium are as varied as the ships that carry them.

Alternatively, the GM can select these Complications instead.\n-   Once the Complication has been determined, the players build their ship. Based on their hull and the drive they select, they will have a certain amount of Space and Power.\n-   Next, players must select what type of crew their vessel has. All ships start with a Competent Crew with a Skill Level of 30. The cost of the crew is included with the cost of the ship's hull. If players wish to, they can gain an additional 5 Ship Points to spend on their vessel by downgrading their Crew to Incompetent (20).

If damaged, a starship's Crew Population and Morale can be restored back up to these maximums, but not above them. This may seem strange, since both Crew Population and Morale are abstract representations, rather than a concrete measurement of crewmembers or their loyalty. However, just consider these Components to be increasing the loyalty of the crew, or the amount of warm bodies aboard the ship, and subsequently making either value slightly more resilient to losses.\n\n# Hulls \n\nA ship's hull determines much about a ship. Primarily, the hull dictates how much space is available for the ship's components, but hulls also place limits on speed, manoeuvrability, ship integrity, and even amour. Although ship hulls are almost always different in size or shape, they can be organised into several general types: transport, raider, frigate, light cruiser, cruiser, grand cruiser and battlecruiser.\n\n## Transports\n\nTransports are easily the most common starships found in the Imperium. Tasked with the often thankless job of hauling goods from one end of the galaxy to the other, transports are large, slow, and designed to carry as much cargo as possible within their hulls. Nevertheless, these vessels are almost single-handedly responsible for maintaining the integrity of humanity's domain. Hive worlds, for example, would not long survive without regular shipments of food and water from agri-worlds, and for many far-flung colonies, the regular passage of a chartist captain or tramp freighter is their only communication with the larger Imperium. Transports sacrifice speed, manoeuvrability, and armour in exchange for cargo space, and while they often have some weapons, they are no match for a true combatant. Thus, transports are often prime targets for pirates. A Rogue Trader with a transport will have to rely on his wits to get him out of sticky situations, rather than his guns. However, if he chooses to focus on mercantile pursuits to make his fortune, he will find no better vessel to aid him.\n\n## Raiders\n\nRaiders are a broad class of hulls covering everything from privateers to the destroyers used in the Imperial Navy. Typically, a \"raider\" denotes a vessel designed for speed and combat. This makes them popular with the many pirates and buccaneers who raid the space-lanes, preferring to strike lone vessels swiftly, then flee before they should be noticed by a Navy patrol. The Imperial Navy also makes use of raiders (referred to as destroyers), though they prefer to outfit them with heavy ship-crippling munitions such as torpedoes and send them out to hunt larger vessels. Destroyers' superior speed and manoeuvrability means they can close the range, launch, and escape before the target can fire on them---most of the time. Raiders are some of the fastest ships in the Calixis Sector and Koronus Expanse. Their speed and manoeuvrability is unmatched by other classes, and their firepower is often as good as other vessels of comparable tonnage. To achieve this, however, raiders sacrifice armour and other defences, along with cargo and stowage space. In essence, they are glass cannons, able to throw out heavy fire, but unable to take it in turn. Instead, they rely on evasive manoeuvring and high speed to stay out of the reach of the guns from heavier craft. Heavy raiders are a subset of raiders with larger hulls packed with more weapons. They also have more powerful engines, allowing a heavy raider to carry better armour. They may not be as nimble as their smaller cousins, but, given a straight run, most captains find a heavy raider's 'legs' are just as long. A Rogue Trader must have a talented tactical mind - and a skilled pilot and crew - in order to make the most of a raider. The ships are designed for piracy, devious deeds, and little else. But if that is what a Rogue Trader sets his mind to, he'll find no vessel suits his needs better.\n\n## Frigate\n\nIn many ways, frigates are the pinnacle of the shipbuilder's art. Lean, fast, and dangerous, frigates can outrun anything they can't fight, and destroy anything they can catch. Frigates fill the ranks of Battlefleet Calixis, where they are prized commands for the youngest and most aggressive naval captains. While a frigate may not seem as prestigious as a cruiser or battleship, their versatility means they are the Navy's ship of choice for all manner of actions. Frigates are tasked for convoy escorts, patrols, anti-piracy operations, and even attacks on rebel ships and stations. They routinely skirmish with the frigates and raiders of seditionists, pirates, and even hostile xenos races. Thus, a frigate captain is 'in the mix' much more often than his counterparts aboard the Battlefleet's larger vessels. Frigates are a balance between all aspects of ship design; speed, manoeuvrability, firepower, and defences. A skilled Mechanicus shipwright can even increase their cargo capacity and supply stowage without greatly reducing any other aspects. They are also relatively common ships, often with robust, simple designs. Therefore they are easily modified and maintained. There are countless stories in the Calixis Sector of crippled frigates lost in space, only to limp into port months later after their crews had affected emergency repairs. All this means frigates are some of the most desired ships for enterprising Rogue Traders. A frigate provides a Rogue Trader with almost unlimited options. Trade, exploration, conquest, piracy, all are possible with a properly outfitted frigate and a captain of pluck and nerve at the helm.\n\n## Light Cruiser\n\nLight cruisers are the eyes and ears of the Battlefleet. Smaller and faster than true cruisers, light cruisers have the massive fuel and supply reserves for deep void patrols. These may last for years, even decades, and thus light cruiser commanders must be independent-minded and self-reliant. Light cruisers are also used as the flagships of small squadrons of frigates and destroyers tasked with escorting convoys or hunting pirates. A light cruiser's design is usually balanced between combat and endurance. They have the advantage of being only slightly slower and less manoeuvrable than a frigate, while mounting a capital ship's armament. This is accomplished, however, by giving the light cruiser substantially less armour and reinforced interior bulkheads than a proper cruiser. In short, light cruisers are faster and more manoeuvrable than standard cruisers, but much more fragile. For a wealthy Rogue Trader, a light cruiser may seem attractive. However, there are several hurdles he will have to overcome. Capital warships are substantially rarer in the Calixis Sector than frigates, raiders, or transports, and are usually only found in the Imperial Battlefleet. Even if a rogue trader is able to procure one, the advanced technologies and arcane knowledge required to maintain such vessels is rare, often only found in naval yards and forge worlds. Finally, light cruisers are built as warships, and converting them to other uses can be difficult. If a Rogue Trader has the resources to overcome these issues, however, he'll find himself at the helm of a ship perfect for exploration or war, with few equals in Imperial space.\n\n## Cruiser\n\nA cruiser is a warship through and through. These are the ships of the line of Battlefleet Calixis, the heavy-hitters that fight major naval engagements. These ships are rare---building one takes centuries if not longer, and requires knowledge and technology from mankind's golden age now only known to the most powerful tech-magos. However, each vessel---often fi e or more kilometres long---carries the firepower to burn planets. They are designed to win wars, and the Imperial Navy guards them zealously. Cruisers carry large banks of weapons and are heavily armoured. They have huge engines, but due to their size, their speed and manoeuvring is not spectacular. This is good for a cruiser's smaller opponents, since their only chance against these behemoths is to flee. Indeed, cruiser designers expect their craft will most often fight other cruisers, and will mount powerful weapons designed specifically to slay these ships. For a Rogue Trader, a cruiser is a vessel filled with both promise and peril. All the problems that come with a light cruiser are multiplied ten-fold here. Often these vessels cannot be bought for any amount of money, and may only be procured through some truly worthy deed (or equally villainous scheme). Even if a Rogue Trader manages to get his hands on a cruiser, he will find a universe of enemies scheming to take it from him. A cruiser is an invaluable treasure, after all. However, a Rogue Trader with the resources, cunning, and ruthlessness to get a cruiser and keep it, it is an unrivalled power beholden to no-one but himself.\n\n## Battlecruiser\n\nThe battlecruiser concept arose as a result of the perceived failures of the older grand cruiser designs. These had been built around advanced experimental drive systems, which ultimately proved to be unacceptably prone to catastrophic malfunction during warp transit. As a result of these issues, grand cruisers came to be regarded by many as cursed ships. Furthermore, during the internecine conflict of the Age of Apostasy, several of the skills required to safely maintain the arcane technologies of the grand cruisers were lost, rendering them hazardous. Yet there was still a gap in the Imperial armoury for a heavy cruiser, a vessel which straddled the gap between a \"classic\" cruiser like the Lunar class and a full battleship. Numerous small task forces required a powerful flagship, yet the potent and precious battleships could not be spared for every such engagement. Using the simpler technologies of the latter Imperial cruisers, and the power systems of battleships, the master tech-masons of the Adeptus Mechanicus produced an elegant hybrid, the battlecruiser, during the latter 36th Millennium. Designed to provide the fleet with the long range punch of battleship weaponry in a cruiser-sized hull, battlecruisers are forged purely for heavy engagements between vast capital vessels, and excel in this narrow speciality. They overpower cruisers by virtue of their overcharged weaponry; very few ships can out-shoot a battlecruiser. Typically somewhat smaller and more lightly armoured than their predecessors, the grand cruisers, battlecruisers are nevertheless more economical, safer and more reliable. What they lack in heavy armour and exotic drive systems is more than made up for in raw firepower. Jealously guarded by battlefleet admirals, it is rare for these powerful ships to end up in the ragtag Rogue Trader fleets, but on occasion a particularly influential or devious individual will intrigue his way into the command of a battlecruiser.\n\n## Grand Cruiser\n\nGrand cruisers are vastly powerful and archaic warships, remnants of a more technologically advanced era of Imperial history. Only battleships carry heavier armour or wield more firepower. These vessels were once the core of battlefleet squadrons, tough warships designed for concerted broadside actions and punishing void-duels. Now few in number, they are in many ways relics of a bygone age. Very few grand cruisers have been constructed in recent millennia, the entire concept having fallen out of favour in many battlefleets. Their revolutionary and highly sophisticated warp and realspace engine designs are now poorly understood, leading to many well publicised disasters and warp calamities. Indeed, the fleets of the archenemy contain the reinvigorated hulks of many formerly proud Imperial grand cruisers lost in the warp due to the gradual dilution of the sacred knowledge needed to render these imposing ships safe. Regarded by many suspicious senior staff officers in the Imperial Navy as dangerous, temperamental, and constructed using dubious and possibly heretical technologies, the surviving grand cruisers of the 41st millennium are largely relegated to the reserve fleets. These are motley collections of outdated and mothballed antique warships, held cold and silent in orbit around munitorium depot worlds, ready for one last call to arms. Although incredibly costly, complex, unpredictable and massively demanding in terms of maintenance and manpower, grand cruisers have much to offer Rogue Traders. They are vastly powerful ships, with continent-shattering firepower and ironclad armour that enables them to sweep aside entire squadrons of lesser vessels. As such, these vast craft are surprisingly common among the wealthier rogue trader fleets, especially given the willingness of cunning battlefleet lord admirals to divest themselves of what they regard as expensive and hazardous anachronisms.\n\n# Complications\n\n## Machine Spirit Oddity\n\n| Roll | Complication|\n|---|---|\n| **1** | A Nose for Trouble: Something about this ship quivers at the thought of battle, always probing the cosmos for a new victim. Add +5 to the ship's Detection, and reduce this ship's Armour by 1, due to its many battles. Occasionally, the crew may find themselves in fights they might have preferred to avoid.  |\n| **2** | Blasphemous Tendencies: Some unidentifiable aspect of this vessel's spirit resonates sympathetically with the Immaterium. Captains find this ship swims through the warp more easily, as if it was more at home there... All Navigation Tests made to pilot this vessel through the warp gain a +15 bonus. However, while aboard the ship, all crew suffer –5 to Willpower based Tests.  |\n| **3** | Martial Hubris: The ship has a glorious legacy of warfare and triumphant combats. It is always eager to fight, and unwilling to back down. The ship gains +5 to all Ballistic Skill Tests to fire its weapons, but suffers –15 on any Operate (Voidship) Tests made to escape combat.  |\n| **4** | Rebellious: This vessel does not suffer authority willingly. At times is seems to take pleasure in interfering with the plans of its masters. During no more than one space combat per game session, the GM should randomly select one of the ship's Components that becomes unpowered until repaired. However, whenever the ship suffers a critical hit (for any reason) roll 1d10. On a 8 or higher, the critical effect is ignored.  |\n| **5** | Stoic: The vessel behaves like a beast of burden, plodding but reliable. Due to its somewhat plodding behaviour, whenever the crew would gain Profit Factor from an Endeavour, reduce the amount gained by 1. However, whenever one of the ship's Component's becomes damaged or unpowered, roll 1d10. On a 7 or higher, the ship shrugs off the damage and it is ignored.  |\n| **6** | Skittish: The ship fears battle, bucking against its masters when entering the fray. When in combat, reduce the ship's Speed by 1. However, when not in danger, it runs eagerly and fast. Reduce the travel time for any long distance (between stars) voyage by 1d5 weeks, to a minimum of 1.  |\n| **7** | Wrothful: The ship's spirit constantly smoulders with anger. In battle, it explodes into a berserker fury, straining and exhausting its systems. During combat, the ship gains +1 Speed and + 7 Manoeuvrability. Out of combat, the ship suffers –1 Speed and –5 to Manoeuvrability and Detection.  |\n| **8** | Resolute: There is little in the universe that can stagger this vessel. No matter the foe, it will advance slowly but surely to meet it. The ship suffers –1 Speed, but gains +3 Hull Points and grants a +10 bonus to all Repair Tests.  |\n| **9** | Adventurous: The vessel is eager to seek new horizons, to turn its bow from civilisation and delve into the darkness of the unknown. When participating in an Endeavour the ship gains +10 Detection, when not participating in an Endeavour it suffers –10 Detection.  |\n| **10** | Ancient and Wise: This ship is of a bygone age, having survived many millennia of voyages and adventures. It's hull has weakened over the centuries, but it anticipates the needs of its crew, and will move as one with a competent master. The ship suffers –4 Hull Integrity but gains a +10 bonus to any Manoeuvre Actions it performs (including out of combat and ramming). |\n\n## Past History\n\n| Roll | Complication|\n|---|---|\n| **1** | Reliquary of Mars: Somehow, this vessel has been outfitted with ancient archaeo-tech systems from mankind's forgotten past. When constructing this vessel, players must select 1 Archeotech Component of their choice. However, any Tech-Use Tests to repair the ship suffer a –20, due to the highly complex nature of the machinery. Additionally, the tech priests of Mars regard the vessel as holy, or at least having holy components. Some may petition to visit the vessel, others may want it for themselves.  |\n| **2** | Haunted: Some nameless horror haunts this vessel's past, leaving voidsmen to whisper stories of ghosts wandering through the corridors and cabins. Reduce Morale permanently by 10. However, strange premonitions flicker on the auger arrays, granting a +6 to the ship's Detection. Additionally, all non-crewmembers suffer –5 to Command Tests involving boarding actions or hit and run actions against the haunted vessel. The presence of these spirits may cause many other issues, depending on their origins and how they came to haunt the vessel (something the GM should determine).  |\n| **3** | Emissary of the Imperator: The vessel is a veritable monument to the power and grandeur of the God-Emperor's might. Awe-inspiring and terrible, it lacks subtlety. All Intimidate Tests made by characters from this vessel gain +15, while all other social Skill Tests suffer a –5. These bonuses and penalties only apply if the character is known to be from the vessel. In addition, few will be able to see beyond the symbolism of the vessel - xenos see a threat, faithful Imperial citizens see a symbol of civilisation (or possibly chastisement), and heretics and rebels see a hated foe. Their reactions will be coloured accordingly.  |\n| **4** | Wolf in Sheep's Clothing: Beneath this vessel's unassuming exterior is a dangerous spacefaring predator. The captain selects three Components. When scanned or subjected to anything but a thorough internal inspection, these components will either not register on the scans, or appear to be a different Component of the same type. Thus, the ship might hide additional armour plating, or a small macrobattery may be much more powerful than it appears. However, the ship suffers –2 Power to maintain the systems creating the illusion. The ship may also have concealed smuggling compartments, unseen passageways, hidden cogitation-override programming, or other secrets.  |\n| **5** | Turbulent Past: Over the years this ship has been used to perform deeds dastardly to some and heroic to others. The GM selects a social group (pirates, heretics, the Imperial Navy, the Inquisition, or inhabitants of an important locale like Footfall). All ship's crew suffer a –20 to social Skill Tests when interacting with that group. The GM then selects a second group naturally opposed to the first. All ship's crew gain +20 to social Skills when interacting with that group. The additional problems that could arise from being hated by a particular group of people are limitless.  |\n| **6** | Death Cult: Amongst the low-decks indentured crew, strange perversions of the Imperial Creed have arisen, glorifying death to celebrate the Emperor. Reduce Crew Population permanently by 8. However, reduce all Morale loss from any source by 2, due to the crew's unwavering faith. Additionally, ship officers and members of the Ministorum will have to deal warily with the cult and its leaders. Death cults do produce skilled assassins...  |\n| **7** | Wrested from a Space Hulk: The ship has been recovered from a space hulk - a mass of wrecked ships that drifts intermittently through the warp and realspace. The ship is very old (and thus of high quality), but those who know of its origins whisper that it is cursed. The ship gains +1 Armour, +1 Speed, and +3 Manoeuvrability. However, every time the crew suffers a Misfortune, the GM rolls twice and chooses the worse of the two. The curse can have many other effects as well, many ill, but a truly skilled Rogue Trader can turn any situation to profit...  |\n| **8** | Temperamental Warp Engine: The ship suffers a flutter in its Warp Engines, an inconsistency that no amount of maintenance or supplication can eliminate. Whenever the ship travels through the immaterium, the GM should roll 1d10. On a 6 or lower, the journey takes an additional 1d5 weeks, on a 7 or higher, the travel time is reduced 1d5 weeks instead (potentially causing the ship to arrive before it left!). However, once in a great while, the ship will leave the warp to unexpectedly find itself someplace other than its intended destination. (This is at the GM's discretion, but should not happen on a regular basis.)  |\n| **9** | Finances in Arrears: The ship was purchased with borrowed funds. The money could have come from a criminal organisation, influential noble, or even a member of the Inquisition—but no matter the source, the debt must be repaid. Whenever the crew attempts to complete an Endeavour's Objective, they must accumulate an additional 50 Achievement Points to accomplish the Objective. However, the ship's financier supports his investment by providing aid and information. All crew can count their financier as a reliable contact. Additionally, their creditor may require the crew to perform specific missions that they are in no position to refuse.  |\n| **10** | Xenophilous: Through dealings with some xenos race, this vessel has been outfitted with examples of their blasphemous technology. When constructing this vessel, players must select 1 Xenotech Component of their choice. However, any Tech-Use Tests to repair the ship suffer a –30, due to the strange and blasphemous nature of the machinery. Should the character attempting the repairs have Forbidden Lore (Xenos), the penalty is only –10. Also, the forces of the Ordo Xenos have an interest in the vessel and who controls it. |\n\n\n# Components\n\nShips are made up of various Components, all contained within the ship's hull. These Components are what makes a ship a ship---without them, it would only be an empty framework. There are two types of Components: Essential Components and Supplemental Components. Essential Components are what all ships need in order to operate. These include the bridge, plasma drives, warp drive, life support, and the like. Supplemental Components may be useful, but a ship can still operate without them. They include cargo bays, weapons, and passenger quarters.\n\nComponents use two finite resources on a ship, Space and Power. There is a limited amount of room within a ship's hull, and the ship's plasma drives only provide so much energy. A Component needs both in order to be used by the ship's crew.\n\nIf a Component does not have power, it is unpowered. Unpowered Components are lightless, powerless sections of a ship, where there is no gravity and no air. Those who wish to enter them must use void-suits. Needless to say, they do not provide any of their listed benefits or bonuses to the ship.\n\nIf a Component does not have space, it is exposed. Exposed Components are mounted outside the ship's hull. They can still have power and be used---a passenger pod could be suspended on the outside of the ship and still have light, heat, and air. However, the module does not receive any benefits from the ship's armour or structural integrity. During combat, they will absorb the first hit to make it through the ship's shields, and be destroyed. Any crew unfortunate enough to occupy the Component at the time will be killed. However, some Components will have the external trait. These Components have been designed to be mounted outside a starship's hull and are placed in protected alcoves or shielded by strange technologies. An external Component does not take up Space, and cannot be destroyed except by a Critical Hit.\n\n## Essential Components\n\nAll ships have certain vital Components, without which they could not operate. These Components are included in a ship's basic design. They cannot be removed (lest the vessel turn into an expensive and useless hulk), but may be upgraded---replacing older and less useful Components with more powerful versions. These Essential Components are specifically for starships capable of warp-travel---a system defence monitor or inter-system tug, for example, would not require a warp drive or Geller Field.\n\nA warp-capable starship's Essential Components are the following:\n\n### Hull\n\nThe framework on which a starship is constructed, a hull, more than anything else, defines a starship. This is also one of the few Components that cannot be upgraded.\n\n### Plasma Drives\n\nGigantic edifices of almost incomprehensible technology, plasma drives take up immense amounts of space within a starship's hull. Without one, a starship is little better than a cold, drifting tomb.\n\n### Warp Drives\n\nThe vast majority of starships are consigned to toil through space at speeds much slower than light. They have the unenviable choice of remaining trapped within a single star system, or spending centuries travelling to even the closest suns. The warp drive provides a shortcut, allowing a vessel to enter the terrifying realm known as the immaterium. If a ship can survive here, it can reach destinations within weeks or months instead of years---essential for a Rogue Trader.\n\n### Void Shields\n\nVoid shields create barriers of energy around a starship. The weaker versions on transports exist mainly to deflect celestial debris, while a military vessel's void shield is strong enough to absorb incoming fire.\n\n### Geller Field\n\nThough a void shield protects a starship in space, it is of no use against the nightmarish inhabitants of the warp. For that, a warp-capable ship requires a Geller Field. This technology has existed since long before the Age of Strife, and creates a bubble of normalcy in that realm of chaos, and makes sure its creatures stay outside the hull.\n\n### Life-Sustainer\n\nWithout the pumps, bellows, and filters of the life-sustainer, the air of a starship would soon be toxic fog, and the water, undrinkable sludge. Life-sustainers purify the ship's atmosphere and recycle waste to produce clean water.\n\n### Crew Compartments\n\nEven the smallest transports require thousands of crewmembers to operate. Many are menial labourers press-ganged from the depths of hives, others are skilled void-men trained to operate a starship's many systems. Regardless, they all require a place to live, be it a mouldy bunk or well-appointed cabin.\n\n### Bridge\n\nJust like every body must have a head, every starship must have a bridge. Here, from his command-pulpit, the captain directs his vessel and the actions of his thousands of crew. Here also are the advanced cogitators that direct the ship's targeting systems, sensors, and other systems.\n\n### Sensors\n\nSight is of little use when dealing with the vast distances of the void. Auspexes, grav-detectors, and auger arrays can spy the reflected light from a tumbling asteroid---or heat from an enemy vessel---thousands or even millions of kilometres away. More advanced sensors can even spot the warp-wake of a vessel traversing the Immaterium.\n\n## Supplemental Components\n\nThough they are not needed for a ship to exist, many Supplemental Components are vital for a starship's operations and even survival. There are many different types of Supplemental Components, aiding in everything from combat to cargo transport. Some of the more common types are weapons, passenger compartments, armour, plating, cargo holds, and the distinctive armoured prows of Imperial warships, made up of 30 metres of adamantium or more.\n\nWhen installing Weapon Components, they must be placed in one of the starship's Weapon Capacity slots. For example, a starship that has a Weapon Capacity of Dorsal 1 and Prow 1 can have one dorsal weapon and one prow weapon, no more. Certain Weapon Components may only be installed in certain classes of ships, or in certain Weapon Capacity slots.\n\n### Lances\n\nIf a lance weapon is installed on a vessel of frigate size or smaller (transports and raiders, for example), it must be installed in a prow weapon slot. Lances are large and cumbersome weapons and in respects to smaller vessels, can only be installed on ships specifically designed to carry them. If a ship of frigate size or smaller does not have a prow weapon slot, it cannot carry a lance.\n\n### Landing Bays\n\nWhen acquired, a Landing Bay comes equipped with one squadron per point of strength (these may be fighters, bombers, assault boats, Aeronautica, or shuttle craft). However, the GM may decide that the players have to Acquire the small craft separately, or, if he prefers to offer his group more versatility, he can have the landing bays come with two squadrons per point of Strength. The types of craft in these squadrons must be designated when the bay is acquired. Any replacement or additional small craft must be Acquired separately.\n\nGenerally, Imperial landing bays' structural designs require them to be included along the port or starboard flanks of a ship. Certain patterns may allow otherwise, but unless specified in the entry, a Landing Bay must be installed on a Port or Starboard Weapon Capacity Slot.\n\n### Nova Cannons \n\nVery few weapons are capable of creating a blast effect that can encompass multiple warp-capable starships. These rare and massive bore weapons are distinguished by that capacity. Nova Cannons must be installed in a Prow Weapon Capacity Slot.\n\n### Torpedo Tubes \n\nTorpedoes offer a vessel the opportunity to inflict tremendous damage at extreme range. They are particularly effective in enabling a squadron of smaller ships to overcome much larger warp-capable vessels. Torpedo Tubes are required to store and launch torpedoes. Vessels armed with these are capable of firing torpedoes. Unless specified in the entry, a Torpedo Tube must be installed in a Prow or Keel Weapon Capacity Slot.\n\n# Ship Points\n\nWhen constructing a starship, the players are limited by one other factor — the amount of Ship Points available to them (See Profit Factor). Basically, the more Ship Points a charter provides, the bigger and better equipped a player's ship can be. When first constructing their ship before beginning a game, players can only build as powerful a ship as their total Ship Points allow. Hulls and certain Components have a Ship Point value listed, and once the players have completed their vessel, the combined ship point total cannot exceed their Ship Point total.\n\nEssential Components are for the most part an exception to the ship point rule, and can be taken freely. Since each ship needs them, their cost has already been included in the hull cost. Certain specialised Essential Components do have ship point costs — to represent their value and rarity.\n\nAny Ship Points left over after creating the starship are added to the group's starting Profit Factor. \n\nHowever, the Ship Point limit only applies at ship creation. Afterwards, players are only limited in which Components they can put in their ship by the ship's Space and Power, and their available Profit Factor.\n\n# Acquiring a Starship \n\nIn rare cases, the Explorers may even wish to acquire a whole starship rather than just starship components. To find the base Acquisition Modifier for a new vessel, the modifier is based on the size of its hull. A ship's Hull Modifier is equal to the hull's worth in Ship Points. Because starships are extremely rare and powerful, only one warp-capable vessel may be acquired at a time. In addition, no additional modifiers aside from those gained by a successful Commerce Test may assist with Acquisition Tests to acquire a starship - the fact that a Rogue Trader \"is only buying one!\" does not make things any easier. \n\nIt is important to note that building a brand-new starship is an exacting task requiring many years (often decades) and much toil. Normally, building new starships is reserved to the Imperial Navy. Rogue Traders are far more likely to acquire a recomissioned Naval vessel or repair and refit a salvaged derelict.\n\n### Example\nSarvus Trask is a Rogue Trader with a Profit Factor of 50. He wishes to acquire a new Havoc-class Raider to protect his interests. The Havoc-class costs 35 Ship Points, and thus Sarvus suffers a –35 modifier to his Acquisition Test.\n","excerpt":"# Constructing A Starship   When creating a starship, players should proceed along the following steps:"},{"srdPath":"starships/deep_void_run","title":"The Deep Void Run","content":"# The Deep Void Run \n\nThough the Imperium of Man claims that vast swaths of the galaxy are subservient to the Golden Throne of Terra, it would be more accurate to describe mankind's dominion as tiny islands adrift in an enormous ocean. The space between stars is so huge that any claim of control is laughable, and so the majority of the Imperium remains safe, huddled around the fires of their stars. However, it is through these uncharted depths that mankind's ships must travel. Even with the help of warp drives-and the immaterium is a fickle ally at best-travel between star systems can take as long as months, or even years. Beyond the bounds of the Imperium, where the fires of civilisation are even farther apart, the journeys could even take decades.\n\nGenerally, a starship stocks at least six month's food and supplies in its lockers-although some vessels may cram an extra month's supplies on board if they anticipate a long journey. These stores can be stretched to last longer, although at a cost to the crew. As rations dwindle, fresh water grows scarce, and even the very air becomes thick and stale, sickness spreads easily and the tempers of the crew flare.\n\nThe consequences of long journeys are varying, and the GM is encouraged to invent hardships appropriate to the situation. Generally, for each month spent beyond the six month limit, the ship loses 2 Morale, and should suffer a misfortune such as the ones listed below:\n\n## Shipboard Sickness\n\nThe stale air and water ensure the easy spread of disease. A successful Medicae Test (difficulty at the GM's discretion) can contain sickness; otherwise the ship will suffer 1d5 damage to Crew Population and Morale as it runs its course.\n\n## Scurvy\n\nScarce food makes for poor nutrition. Little can be done about the lack of proper nutrients, and the loss of some of the weaker and sicker members of the crew will do 1d5 damage to Crew Population.\n\n## Weary Machine Spirit\n\nLong voyages strain the systems of a starship, sometimes to the breaking point. Without a full shipyard, repairs are often temporary. The GM should select a Component. For every month the ship spends at space without visiting a shipyard or civilised planet for proper repairs, a character must make a Tech-Use Test or the Component becomes damaged. These tests should become progressively harder.\n\n## Starvation\n\nFew things are as worrying as a starship's food stores running low, both because of the threat of starvation and because it is likely to make the crew desperate and rebellious. Starvation is not something that should happen unless a ship has been at space for longer than a year or had its food stores drastically reduced for some reason. Once it begins, however, the ship will suffer 1 damage to Crew Population and 2 to Morale every day it does not find a habitable planet or other means to refill its food stores.\n\nOf course, the threat of mutiny is also present when crews are confined within iron bulkheads without the warm sun or fresh air for months or years on end. This is represented by the Morale loss a ship suffers, but the GM should feel free to expand on this, inventing mutinous low-decks plots or even treacherous mid-rank officers scheming to take the starship away from the characters.\n","excerpt":"# The Deep Void Run   Though the Imperium of Man claims that vast swaths of the galaxy are subservient to the Golden Throne of Terra, it would be more accurate to describe mankind's dominion as tiny islands adrift in an enormous ocean. The space between stars is so huge that any claim of control is laughable, and so the majority of the Imperium remains safe, huddled around the fires of their stars. However, it is through these uncharted depths that mankind's ships must travel. Even with the help of warp drives-and the immaterium is a fickle ally at best-travel between star systems can take as long as months, or even years. Beyond the bounds of the Imperium, where the fires of civilisation are even farther apart, the journeys could even take decades."},{"srdPath":"starships/navigating_the_warp","title":"Navigating the Warp","content":"# Navigating the Warp \n\nThe primary role of all Navigators is guiding ships into, through, and out of the warp. Whilst the rest of the ship's crew and the ship's captain maintain the systems of the ship, keeping the vessel's plasma and warp drives functioning and its Gellar Field strong, the Navigator carefully studies the currents and fluctuations of the warp as well as the distance and strength of the Astronomican. Using this information, he tells the captain to make course corrections and when it is wise to leave or enter the warp. The actual Translation-as entering and exiting the warp is known-from real space to warp space or vice versa is relatively simple and does not require the skill of a Navigator, though his input can be invaluable lest the vessel find itself immediately assailed by an empyreal storm, warp rift, or worse. Once the vessel is in the warp, however, not having a Navigator would leave a captain with no idea as to the vessel's position relative to real space, the distance they have travelled, or where they will end up when the ship exits the warp except crude guesswork based on existing warp charts. The Fundamentals of Warp Navigation Navigating the warp in game terms consists of a number of stages at which the Navigator must test to perceive the nature of the warp and then steer a course through it. These stages are:\n\n-   Stage One: Determining Duration of Passage\n-   Stage Two: Locating of the Astronomican\n-   Stage Three: Charting the Course\n-   Stage Four: Steering the Vessel\n-   Stage Five: Leaving the Warp\n\nEach of these stages and the tests requires are detailed below.\n\n## Stage One: Determining Duration of Passage \n\nThe duration of a voyage is measured in subjective time; time as experienced by the Navigator and the crew of the vessel in days and hours of \"untroubled passage.\" This calculation assumes that the vessel is following a favourable warp current and operating under good conditions. If all goes well the voyage will pass in this time. The base time of a voyage through the warp is determined by the Game Master and then modified by how well the Navigator steers the course of his craft. The figure is selected by the Games Master and kept secret from the Navigator and other players, though a Navigator may attempt to estimate the duration of passage based on what he knows of the course he must steer (see below); he might be right or he may be wildly incorrect based upon actual conditions in the warp when the passage is attempted. The duration of passage set by the GM is used as the base value for all of the subsequent stages of travel.\n\n### The Navigator's Estimate \n\nA Navigator preparing a passage he is familiar with, or for which he has good navigational information, (such as a chart or navigational cipher), will have a good sense of how long it should take to arrive at his destination. In order to determine this, the Navigator can make a **Navigation (Warp) Test** (although what modifiers for difficulty apply and whether this is passed or failed should be kept secret by the GM). If he passes, the GM should give him a roughly accurate estimate of how long the voyage should take under the expected conditions. If he fails, then his estimate will be inaccurate, although just how much it is off by is up to the GM to determine, based on how badly the test was failed.\n\n### Going into the Unknown \n\nIt is quite possible that a Navigator must plot a course to a location with which he is not familiar, in which case he may have no real idea of easy it will be to reach or how long it will take. In these circumstances, the GM should not give the Navigator an estimation of how long the journey may take beyond the roughest \"educated guess.\"\n\n### Example Durations of Passage\n| Passage Within the Warp | Example Voyage  |\n|---|---|\n| **1 day** | Short passage between two close systems by a well-travelled stable warp route.  |\n| **5-10 days** | A journey between systems in the same sub-sector using accurate navigational information.  |\n| **30-60 days** | A journey across the body of a full Imperial sector (such as Calixis) using accurate information and known warp routes.  |\n| **100+ Days** | A perilous journey across a Segmentum at best speed avoiding only the worst known hazards.  |\n| **Several Years** | An odyssey across the galaxy. |\n\n### The Passage of Time in Real Space \n\nThe subjective time experienced by those travelling through the warp is different from that that passes in the physical world. The amount by which time experienced within the warp and real space varies is not fixed, but if it is necessary to calculate how much time has passed in the real world whilst a ship was in the warp, use a ratio of one day of passage in the \"open warp\" to 12 days passing in real space on average. The Game Master should, however, feel free to vary this ratio as he sees fit and on the most stable warp routes this should be less (even in 1 to 1 parity in some places), and in turbulent areas potentially much worse. Factual accounts of ships arriving at their destination centuries late are thankfully extremely rare, but known (and should never \"randomly\" occur during the game). There have even been accounts of ships that have actually arrived at their destination before they have left!\n\n## Stage Two: Location of the Astronomican\n\nWhen a vessel Translates into the warp, a Navigator must gauge the strength of the Astronomican, to judge just how far and in what direction he is from Terra so that he may then plot a course. To do this, he makes an **Ordinary (+10) Awareness Test**. For every degree of success achieved, add **+10 to any Navigation (Warp) skill tests for this voyage, whilst for every degree of failure a -10 modifier is imposed instead**. If the test is failed by three or more degrees of failure, the Astronomican cannot be located-the Halo Stars are notorious for difficulties in finding the beacon's signal. In some rare cases, the Astronomican cannot be found- especially turbulent warp storms and other unnatural phenomena may obscure its signal, or the Navigator's vessel may simply have travelled beyond the Astronomican's reach. **If the Navigator cannot locate the beacon of the Astronomican, he must pass a Hellish (-60) Navigation (Warp) Test in order to chart a successful course.** Without the Astronomican, the Navigator must rely upon his own experience, skill, and ancient charts of real- and warpspace (some especially accurate charts may, at the GM's discretion, grant a bonus to this Test). If he fails the Test, the Navigator may not try again unless at the GM's discretion, or if a transient event (such as a warpstorm) ends.\n\n## Stage Three: Charting the Course\n\nOnce the Navigator has a point of reference, he must then use his extraordinary perceptions to determine any turbulence, strange phenomena, or storms laying in wait in the Empyrean that will affect the passage of the vessel as it travels. This is accomplished by an **Ordinary (+10) Navigation (Warp) Test, whose results are kept secret by the GM**. Success means that if there is any significant warp disturbance along the route then the Navigator has likely detected it, failure means that he has not. In either case, should the Navigator fail this roll, he will be ignorant of any dangers that lay ahead. The effects of this test will influence the chance of avoiding serious warp encounters (see Table Warp Travel Encounters) during the voyage.\n\n## Stage Four: Steering the Vessel\n\nWith the Astronomican located and the local state of the warp gauged, the Navigator now makes his Navigation roll to determine both the accuracy of his voyage and travel time. This is a **Navigation (Warp) Skill Test** modified by the Navigator's perception of the Astronomican (see Stage Two) and the general difficulty of the passage. Refer to the Navigation Chart to see the results of this test.\n\n### Difficulty of Passage \n\nThe Game Master should choose a duration of passage based on how difficult the voyage is and how far away the intended destination. Travel through \"open warp\" where no unusual phenomena or turbulence occur should be a Routine (+20) Navigation test. If the Navigator is using an established warp route or corridor, or has detailed information such as the secret charts found in a Navis Prima, the test should be considered Easy (+30). Where passages are attempted into the unknown, or where general conditions in the warp are known to adverse (prone to storms, etc.), tests should be Difficult (-10) or worse. Alternatively, if the route is very well established and the Navigator has previously travelled it many times, the GM may decide that the Navigator need not make a roll at all nor test for Warp Travel Encounters.\n\n\n### Navigation Chart\n\n| Degrees of Success / Failure | Result  |\n|---|---|\n| **3+ Degrees of Success** | Destination reached in a quarter of the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |\n| **2 Degrees of Success** | Destination reached in half of the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |\n| **1 Degree of Success** | Destination reached in three quarters of the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |\n| **Success** | Destination reached in the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |\n| **Failure** | Destination reached in twice the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |\n| **1 Degrees of Failure** | Destination reached in three times the duration set by the GM in Step 1  |\n| **2+ Degrees of Failure** | Destination reached in four times the duration set by the GM in Step 1 |\n\n### Off Course\n\nIf a Navigator fails his Navigation (Warp) test and rolls a 9 on either dice, he is thrown off course, the vessel will appear in the wrong system or part of space (as determined by the GM).\n\n### Encounters in the Warp\n\nWarp travel is seldom a routine and dull affair, and the Navigator must maintain constant vigilance lest the vessel become lost or imperiled. This peril increases the longer the vessel spends in the warp and the further it travels. To reflect the perils of warp travel, the Navigator should make a roll on Table Warp Travel Encounters once for every five full days of travel within the warp. If a journey takes under five days to complete, one roll on the Warp Travel Encounters table is still made. Each of the rolls for warp encounters gains a +20 bonus if the Navigator succeeded in the Navigation test whilst Assessing Warp Conditions in Stage Three.\n\n#### Warp Travel Encounters\n| Roll | Event | Description |\n|---|---|---|\n| **01-03** | *Reality Erosion* | The very fabric of the vessel is altered in some way. Walls might melt, statues and picture come to life or gravity itself may become twisted.  |\n| **04-09** | *Plague of Madness* | A general madness infects the crew, and without swift action bedlam can ensure. It will target the weakest of will first, but can be spread by contact.  |\n| **10-18** | *Incursion* | A daemonic entity slips aboard the vessel and sets out to wreak havoc. Particularly insidious warp creatures can hide on a ship for years masking their actions as bad luck and careless accidents.  |\n| **19-26** | *Lost Time* | Time contracts and expands during the voyage, and though it may take but a few days, the crew will feel as if months or more has passed, fraying their sanity.  |\n| **27-33** | *Ghost Ships* | The ship's sensors detect phantom ships that appear and vanish randomly. Wise captains ignore such things, though if they are real, a vessel lost in the warp can still hold valuable cargo.  |\n| **34-39** | *Shoals and Reefs* | The vessel runs afoul of a warp shoal or reef that threatens to break it open on a jagged fragment of false reality. A good helmsman and skilled Navigator are required to pass unscathed.  |\n| **40-48** | *Visitations* | One or more of the crew find themselves visited by warp shades of lost friends or family. These lost souls might offer helpful advice and comfort or have darker motives.  |\n| **49-53** | *Gellar Field Fluctuations* | Alarmingly, the Gellar Field that keeps back the baleful energies of the warp begins to fluctuate. Hasty prayers to the Machine God or a return to realspace may be required.  |\n| **54-67** | *Warp Storm* | A terrible warp storm strikes the vessel and may cause damage or throw it off course. Only the skills of the ship's Navigator will decide the outcome.  |\n| **68-75** | *Whispers and Dreams* | Everyone on board suffers from strange dreams and even hears hushed whispers when awake. These might hold hidden truths or portents should the GM wish, or merely be mad ramblings form beyond.  |\n| **76-100** | *All's Well* | A safe journey that wise captains will savour. |\n\n### Gellar Field Failures in Game \n\nHow to represent a Geller Field failure is left up to the GM's imagination, but it should an utterly horrifying experience for players. They must quickly restore the Geller Field if they hope to survive, and even if they accomplish this, they will still be faced with a ship full of monstrous entities. The GM should feel free to pit them against all manner of daemonic adversaries, in any monstrous and terrible forms he chooses. Even if the players triumph, damage to their ship's Morale should be severe, and depending on the severity of the failure, there could be severe damage to Crew Population as well. If the battles were particularly ferocious, certain ship Components could be damaged, depressurized, or even in flames. For the players, killing the daemons may be just the beginning...\n\n## Stage Five: Leaving the Warp\n\nOnce the Navigator\\'s destination has been reached, he must make a **Hard (-20) Navigation (Warp)** Test to determine the accuracy of his entrance point in real space, which in general terms the Navigator can perceive from the warp in a shadowy and indistinct fashion. Succeeding at this test means that the vessel exits the warp were the Navigator intended. A failure means that the ship exits off target (dangerously close to a planetary body rather than in the outer reaches of a system for example), with degrees of failure indicating a more extreme deviation.\n","excerpt":"# Navigating the Warp   The primary role of all Navigators is guiding ships into, through, and out of the warp.

These stages are:"},{"srdPath":"starships/overview","title":"Starships","content":"# Starships\n\n## Anatomy of a Starship \n\nIn the 41st Millennium, a spacefaring vessel is rare and precious. Ships take decades, even centuries to build, if the builders have the required skills and knowledge base in the first place. It is rare to find a \"new\" starship-most are hundreds or thousands of years old, and some date back to the earliest days of the Imperium. Therefore, ships are never mass-produced, and even two ships of the same class are rarely alike. A Lunar-class cruiser produced in the shipyards of Mars will be vastly different from another Lunar hailing from to docks of Port Wrath.\n\nHowever, regardless of class or configuration, all ships share certain components and design similarities. All starships, for example, require plasma drives to propel them through space, armour and void shields to protect them, and a hull to contain these systems. In Rogue Trader, ships have Components, the various parts that make up the starship. Some of these are vital, such as the life support system and genatoria facilities. Without them the ship will not function. Others, such as weapons batteries or luxury passenger quarters, are useful but not essential.\n\nA ship's components, in turn, affect the ship's Characteristics. These Characteristics are similar to the Characteristics of a Rogue Trader Player Character. They represent the various abilities of a ship.\n\n### Characteristics \n\n#### Speed\n\nSpeed measures how fast a ship can move in realspace.\n\n#### Manoeuvrability\n\nManoeuvrability measures how quickly a ship can change direction, avoid obstacles, and evade incoming fire.\n\n#### Detection\n\nDetection measures the power of a vessel's auspexes and augers, and how well they can 'see' their surroundings.\n\n#### Void Shields\n\nVoid Shields create an insubstantial energy barrier around a ship to protect it from enemy attacks.\n\n#### Armour\n\nArmour protects a ship from incoming weapons fire, as well as collisions from celestial dust, rocks, and other detritus.\n\n#### Hull Integrity\n\nHull Integrity is a measure of how reinforced a ship's interior is, and how much damage a ship can take before breaking up. Isolated compartments, reinforced bulkheads, and blast doors increase Hull Integrity, while long, open passageways and substandard materials decrease it.\n\n#### Power Generation\n\nPower Generation measures the energy the ship generates to run its myriad Components. If a Component is unpowered, it will not function.\n\n#### Space\n\nSpace measures the room in the ship for various Components. If there is not enough Space for a Component, it cannot be contained within the ship's hull.\n\n#### Turret Rating\n\nA starship's turret rating is an abstract representation of how many defensive turrets it has. Turrets are small, short-ranged weapons used for shooting down small attack craft and torpedoes.\n\n#### Weapon Capacity\n\nThese are locations on a starship that have enough room to house the massive main weaponry of starships in the 41st Millennium.\n\n#### SP\n\nThis is how many Ship Points the hull, component, or upgrade costs.\n\n## Representing and Generating Characteristics \n\nLike a character's Characteristics, a ship's Characteristics are represented using numbers. However, unlike a character, a ship's Characteristics are not rated on a scale of 1 to 100. This is because, unlike a character, a ship is an inanimate object. The best ship in the Imperium is useless without an equally competent crew to operate it. Therefore, most of a ship's Characteristics are treated as static numbers to be tested against-similar to a character's Wounds or a piece of armour's AP value.\n\nOther Characteristics, notably Manoeuvrability and Detection, are bonuses or penalties that may be added when a character on board the ship makes an appropriate Skill Test. These represent the concept that some ships are more manoeuvrable or have better augers than others, and a skilled operator is able to get more out of them.\n\nA ship's baseline Characteristics are determined by its hull type. Some hulls, such as a transport, are roomier and able to hold more. Other hulls, such as the raider, are designed for speed and manoeuvrability, but are cramped and relatively fragile.\n\nThese baseline Characteristics can be modified depending on the Components within the ship's hull. Components can provide benefits and drawbacks. For example, larger plasma drives may make a ship faster and provide more power, but they will also take up space which could have been given over to other Components. On the other hand, reinforced adamantine armour plating can increase the ship's Armour, but its Speed and Manoeuvrability might suffer from the increased mass.\n\n## Crew Population and Morale \n\nThe health and well-being of a starship's crew is measured in two ways - its Crew Population and its Morale. Crew Population measures how many people are aboard a starship, indicated by a percentage of 100. Therefore, if a Crew Population was 98, that means 98 percent of the ship's original crew complement is still alive. All ships' Crew Populations begin at 100, though they may be modified by situations or the ship's Components. Morale is also measured on a 1 to 100 scale, starting at 100 and dropping as the starship encounters situations that test its crew's loyalty and commitment. With both Morale and Crew Population, higher values are better. As both values drop, they affect their starship adversely (see Starship Reference) The effects of Crew Population loss and Morale are unavoidable, but the effects are reversible if the Crew Population or Morale are later brought above the threshold. All effects are cumulative, even Crew Population and Morale effects. The effects of Crew Population loss represent the ship becoming harder to operate as there are fewer hands to crew it, while the effects of Morale loss represent the crew actively malingering or doing other activities to hamper the ship's operations.\n\n### Mutiny\n\nIn addition, whenever Morale drops below 70, 40, and 10, the Captain must make a Command Test. If he fails, some portion of his crew rebels against his rule and a mutiny begins. Note: If the ship is in combat when Morale drops below a threshold, wait until after the combat ends to test for a mutiny. If it drops below multiple thresholds during a single combat, only test once. To represent the mutiny, the GM should choose one NPC crewmember to lead the mutiny (or invent basic stats for a general crewmember). The mutiny can be fought or suppressed through opposed Command, Charm, or Intimidation Tests, chosen by the players. One character (who does not have to be the captain) should be chosen to suppress the mutiny and make the selected opposed Skill Test.\n\n-   If the characters chose to use Command, they are leading armsmen to suppress riots, posting guards at critical spaces, and generally waging war against the mutineers directly. If the characters win the opposed Skill Test, the ship suffers 1d5 Crew Population damage and 1d5 Morale damage, but the mutiny ends.\n-   If the characters use Charm, they are meeting with the mutiny's ringleaders, addressing their demands, and trying to placate them. If the characters win the opposed Skill Test, the ship suffers 1d10 Morale damage (the characters are viewed by the crew as weak), but the mutiny ends.\n-   If the characters use Intimidate, they are threatening to open crew quarters into space, shooting ringleaders, holding hostages, and generally showing the crew the dire consequences of their actions. If the characters win the opposed Skill Test, the ship suffers 1 Crew Population damage and 1d10 Morale damage (the crew fears and mistrusts their ruthless commanders), but the mutiny ends.\n\nIf the mutineers win any of these tests, another opposed Skill Test is performed. If the mutineers win again, the cycle continues. If, however, the mutineers ever win one of these tests by three or more degrees of success, the mutiny succeeds. The characters lose control of their ship, and will likely be forced to flee quickly lest they be killed by their former crew.\n\n### Replenishing Morale and Crew Population \n\nRestoring a ship's Morale is often surprisingly simple. The low-decks dregs that make up the majority of a starship crew are an easily satisfied lot, often content with life's simple pleasures-or the promise of Thrones in their pocket.\n\nIf the starship is currently involved in attempting to complete an Endeavour, the captain can bribe the crew with gelt (or the promise of gelt). At any point during a shipboard journey, the ship's captain - or another authority figure - can attempt to restore Morale by losing 50 Achievement Points (from those going towards his current Endeavour) and making a Routine (+20) Charm Test. Success means he has quieted the crew's concerns (or distracted them with their greed). Frigates, transports, and raiders regain 1d10 Morale, while light cruisers and cruisers (being larger) regain 1d5. The captain may do this as many times as he wishes, however the difficulty of the test should increase by one degree each time he does. After all, Thrones are only so good when you have no place to spend them.\n\nA captain or another authority figure can also make a Difficult (-10) Charm or Intimidate Test to rally the crew, regaining 2 Morale for every degree of success. This will only work once per game session, however.\n\nOf course, the best way to restore a crew's Morale is to put into port. If a starship reaches a habitable planet with no traces of civilisation, the ship can spend three weeks at orbital anchor, replenishing supplies and allowing the crew to travel to the surface. This will restore a ship's Morale to maximum. If the planet (or asteroid settlement) is inhabited by a human civilisation, this process will only take two weeks. If the captain is willing to spend some gelt, (making a Routine (+20) Acquisition Test to represent money distributed and reimbursements for damage caused to local drinking dens and brothels), he can restore his ship's Morale in a single week, and completely restock his supplies as well.\n\nRestoring Crew Population can only occur at a planet inhabited by humans. The captain can make an Acquisition Test to restore his Crew Population to maximum, hiring on new crew members from among the locals. The availability of the crew should be considered Common (+20), though this can depend on the world. A hive world may have a large enough population that crew are considered Abundant (+50), while an isolated outpost may put a premium on manpower (Scarce or even Rare). The GM can choose to add bonuses or penalties due to the scale and quality (craftsmanship) of the crew being hired as well. Failure, of course, means the Explorers must look elsewhere for their crew.\n\nHowever, if he prefers, he can send teams of press-gangs into the planet's less savoury locales (be they slave camps, slums, or the underhive) to 'recruit' new crew members. If he does this, a character who is skilled in subterfuge and has contacts with the criminal underworld must make arrangements if the press-gangs are to be successful. The details are up to the GM, but at the very least a Common Lore (Underworld) Test will be required to find the right contacts, and a Commerce Test must be made to secure the deal. Failure could mean that other criminal elements take violent exception to the rogue trader's plans, the local magistratum might step in to arrest all of the characters, or the planet's general population might violently rise up against the Rogue Trader and his party. The benefits, of course, are paying a few press-gang crews will not cut into a Rogue Trader's finances.\n\nA third option is to strike a deal with planetary authorities that will allow the rogue trader to empty their prisons to serve as his crew. If he does this, he restores his Crew Population without cost. However, he immediately loses 1d10+10 points of Morale-which cannot be restored while he remains at this planet.\n\nNo attempts to restore a starship's Crew Population or Morale can increase these values above the starship's maximum Crew Population or Morale values. Any Acquisition Tests made to restore Crew Population or Morale do not count against the number of Acquisitions an Explorer may make in a game session.\n\n## Extended Repairs \n\nTo survive amongst the deep void, starships must be largely self-sufficient. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the case of repairs and maintenance. Any true void-faring vessel has bunkers full of fuel and storage holds with additional supplies and ship components, from delicate cogitator circuitry to massive adamantine plates to weld over hull breaches. Though the supplies are seldom enough to completely repair a starship (especially if it has just come through a truly nasty engagement), they are enough to let the crew patch up the worst of their ship's injuries.\n\nTo perform extended repairs, a starship should locate a suitable anchorage, perhaps high orbit around a gas giant in a deserted star system or nestled against a large asteroid to avoid detection. It's crew will then spend several weeks on the repairs, determined beforehand by the ship's captain. For each week at repairs, the member of the crew directing them must make a Repair test (using an Essential Repair Skill), tallying the degrees of failure and success. If the degrees of failure outnumber the degrees of success at the end of the specified time period, the repairs have failed. If the reverse is true, however, the repairs succeed, and the ship regains 1d5 points of Hull Integrity. This cannot take the ship's Hull Integrity above its maximum. In addition, a successful repair attempt restores all damaged, depressurised, and unpowered Components to full working order. Destroyed Components must be repurchased and replaced.\n\nFor a more thorough repair job, the starship will need to find an inhabited planet or space station - preferably a world with a reasonably advanced level of civilisation (cavemen or feudal peasants will not be much help in repairing a starship). Once a suitable world has been located, the crew can pay to have their starship repaired. If any Hull Integrity is repaired, any damaged, depressurised, and unpowered Components are restored to working order a well.\n\nFor every full five points of Hull Integrity restored, the Explorers must make an Acquisition Test at a -10 penalty (this takes into account the rarity and quantity of materials and supplies). These tests are made sequentially - once one is failed, the Explorers have temporarily exhausted their available funds and must either wait 1d5 weeks until more money is available or seek repairs elsewhere (preferably where there is a better deal). Any Acquisition Tests made to repair Hull Integrity do not count against the number of Acquisitions an Explorer may make in a game session.\n\nFor every point in Hull Integrity restored, the ship must spend one day being repaired. New Components (whether to upgrade existing Components or replace destroyed Components) are purchased as normal, and require 1d5 additional days to install per Component.\n\n## Space Travel\n\nOutside of combat, space travel should be treated abstractly. The distances between a planet and one of its moons can be farther than a man in a land-crawler can drive in a year - the distance between two planets (or two stars) can be orders of magnitude further. An Imperial starship can generally travel the distance between a planet such as Holy Terra and its moon in little more than an hour, while that same starship could take two weeks to travel between the same planet and its star. In general, it shouldn't take much longer than that to get from one location in a star system to another; however, faster starships should take less time, while mass conveyors and other bulk transports may take far longer. In the end, travel times should be left up to the GM.\n","excerpt":"# Starships  ## Anatomy of a Starship "},{"srdPath":"starships/upgrade","title":"Upgrading and Installing New Components in Starships","content":"# Upgrading and Installing New Components in Starships\n\nAn important aspect of owning a starship is improving and modifying it to suit the needs of its crew. This is done by retrofitting the vessel, a long, labour intensive, and time consuming process that often requires a full space-dock or forge world star-yard. It is also likely to be expensive, but can all pay off when marauding space-pirates feel the wrath of a freighter's concealed macro-cannons.\n\nWhen installing or upgrading Components in a starship, the two Characteristics to keep in mind are Space and Power. Each Component requires a certain amount of both, and if a ship is unable to meet those requirements, the new Component will end up unpowered or exposed.\n\nThe two exceptions to this are a ship's plasma drives and hull. Plasma drives are not only the engines that move a ship through the void, they also generate power for the entire ship. Therefore, plasma drives don't have a power requirement. Instead, they provide the ship's power rating—how much power is available for the rest of the ship's Components.\n\nHulls are treated the same way in regards to space. Hulls define the class of vessel, and, of course, have a finite amount of space inside them. Therefore, hulls provide the amount of available space a ship has.\n\nThe cost of new Components is discussed below. The time it takes to install new Components on a starship varies depending on the facilities available. Usually, a human world with at least interplanetary space travel is required to install new Components. Such a world could install a new Component on a starship in roughly three weeks. However, a populous Imperial hive world with competent stardock could do the same task in half the time.\n\n# Acquisition of Starship Components \n\nFew things acquired or maintained by the Explorers' dynasty compare to the astronomical value of their void-ships. When the Explorers wish to acquire new components for their vessel, or commandeer a new vessel, the GM should work out the Acquisition Modifier using the Component's final SP cost, after any modifiers for Craftmanship, as detailed below. However, in place of the Scale Acquisition Modifier, he should use the modifiers detailed in *Table: Starship Component Acquisitions* based on the kind of system being acquired.\n\n## Starship Component Acquisitions\n\n| Component | Modifier |\n|---|---|\n| War (macrobatteries, lances, torpedoes) | –30  |\n| Etheric (auspex, vox-networks, communications) | –20  |\n| Power (warp drive, generatorium, void shields) | –10  |\n| Structure/Other (holds, observatories, armour, special structures, etc.) | +0 |\n\n### Examples\n\nLord-captain Brevarn of the Armsmaiden wishes to refit the great fore macrocannons Primus and Secondus - upgrading them from Common Craftsmanship (1 SP) to Good (2 SP). This increases their rarity from Scarce (-10) to Rare (-20), for a total difference of -10. As a War component, an additional modifier of -30 is added, giving a final Acquisition Modifier of -40. \n\nThe Rogue Trader Jessica Cayde wants to reinforce the prow of her vessel, the Arrayed Claws. The Arrayed Claws is a Raider-class void ship, so a Reinforced Prow has a cost of 1 SP, which gives it an Availability of Scarce (-10). As a Structure component, no additional modifier is added, giving a final Acquisition Modifier of -10. \n\n## Ship Points \n\nShip Points have one other role to play — they determine how rare (and thus how expensive) Components are in Rogue Trader. The chart below lists the Components' availability based on how many Ship Points they cost. However, when determining the Acquisition Threshold required to acquire starship Components, the GM should never give the players a bonus based on Scale — the Threshold should only be determined by availability (and perhaps craftsmanship).\n\n## Component Availability\n\n| Components | Availability |\n|---|---|\n| Supplemental Components costing 1 SP, Essential Components | Scarce (-10)\n| Supplemental Components costing 2 SP, Essential Components costing +1 SP | Rare (-20)\n| Supplemental Components costing 3 SP, Essential Components costing +2 SP | Very Rare (-30)\n| Supplemental Components costing 4 SP, Essential Components costing +3 SP | Extremely Rare (-40)\n| Supplemental Components costing 5 SP, Essential Components costing +4 SP | Near Unique (-50)\n| Supplemental Components costing 6 SP, Essential Components costing +5 SP | Unique (-60)\n| Archeotech Components | Extremely Rare (-40)\n| Xenotech Components | Near Unique (-50)\n\n# Component Craftsmanship and Facilities\n\nEven in the lawless depths of the Expanse, there are fairly well known expectations when making purchases for a vessel. Every Trader worth their warrant knows how much deck space a standard Mark VI Mars-pattern macrocannon emplacement needs, or how much power Stygies pattern torpedo tubes draw in combat. The more skillful Traders know that there are shades of quality to their acquisitions, and depending on the circumstances those acquisitions may differ from that standard.\n\nThe most common difference is simply due to lack of availability or funds. Not all worlds have the required goods at\nthe quality desired—and of course, if the gelt is running low, then one must make due with what's affordable. This holds true when buying a lasgun charge pack or a Titanforge Lance. Alternatively, should Explorers find themselves with a surplus of wealth, they may look to improve the quality of their shipboard Components. Replacing an ordinary Jovian Plasma Drive with one finely tuned and personally blessed by a visiting Tech-Priest Magos is oftentimes worth the investment for a variety of reasons. Usually products of better craftsmanship take up less space or power, due to the more-efficient workings of their ancient designs.\n\nAll of these factors must come into play when the crew plan their acquisitions, perhaps even more so when times are good than when times are lean. Just as only a thin hull stands between air and the void, so does the prepared mind stand between disastrous poverty and long-term wealth. *Table: Component Craftsmanship Modifiers*, represents how the level of quality and craftsmanship for a Component affects its Acquisition and Installation, while *Table: Lance and Macrobattery Craftsmanship Modifiers* shows the performance effects on Lance and Macrobattery weapons (this table should be used instead of *Table: Component Craftsmanship Modifiers*). Other weapons should use *Table: Component Craftsmanship Modifiers*. \n\nNote that a modifier cannot take any original value to zero; should this occur the modified value becomes 1. Even the most well crafted Components need power to function and space to occupy. However, if the original Space or Power requirements were zero, Craftsmanship does not increase these requirements (even in the case of Poor Craftsmanship). No matter how shoddy the armour plating on a warship, for example, they still do not require Power to operate.\n\nIn addition, although Poor Craftsmanship Components reduce Ship Point costs by 1, this can only be reduced to a minimum of 1.\n\n## Craftsmanship And Morale\n\nA ship runs on more than just plasma and adamantium. It also runs on the crew's morale, their faith in their ship and those who command her. Much of the morale level at any given time is determined by what the crew see around them—the ship itself. When they see their masters improving the ship with better Components, they feel more confident in their lot. An ancient cogitator, musty with old smells and covered with seals of numistic purity, lifts the spirits of the most downtrodden ratings. Alternatively, a rusting life sustainer dripping vitae-unguents lowers expectations of survival. \n\nTo represent this, after a Component is installed the ship's Morale is immediately modified based on the Craftsmanship Level as per Table Component Craftsmanship Modifiers. The modifier cannot reduce Morale to below half or take it to above the ship's maximum level. This is not a permanent loss, and may be regained to the ship's maximum.\n\n## Component Craftsmanship Modifiers\n\n| Craftsmanship  | Power | Space | SP | Morale |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Poor | -2 to Generated Power or +1 to Power Consumed | +1 | -1 | -1d5 | \n| Common | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \n| Good (choose either Power or Space Modifier but not both) | +1 to Generated Power or -1 to Power Consumed | -1 | +1 | +1 | \n| Best | +1 to Generated Power or -1 to Power Consumed | -1 | +2 | +1d5 | \n\n## Lance and Macrobattery Craftsmanship Modifiers\n\n| Craftsmanship | Strength | Damage | Crit Rating | Range | Space | SP | Morale | \n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Poor (choose any 2) | -1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | -1d5 | \n| Common | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | \n| Good (choose any 1) | 0 | +1 | 0 | +1 | -1 | +1 | +1 | \n| Best (choose any 2) | +1 | +1 | -1 | +1 | -1 | +2 | +1d5 | \n\n## Common Facility Types & Modifiers\n\n| Facility | Acquisition and Component Modifiers | Installation Modifier | \n|---|---|---|\n| Backwater System | Starship Components are rare and expensive in backwater systems. All Component Availabilities count as one step rarer (Rare becomes Very Rare, for example). | +1d10 days | \n| Civilised System | The standard dockyards for most Explorers. | No modifiers. | None | \n| Colonial System | While most Components can be found, there are few Essential ones the colony can spare. All Essential Component Availabilities count as one step rarer (Rare becomes Very Rare, for example). | +1d5 days | \n| Deep Void Station | A wide variety of all Component types can be found here, but the deal making is tough. Decrease the Availability level of any Component by one, only to find if a Component is available. However, the actual Acquisition Test suffers a –5 penalty. | -1 day | \n| Feral/Feudal System | No Components available, but plenty of manpower to be had. Crew may be replenished as Abundant (+50). | N/A | \n| Liege System | The ruler can get whatever is needed, but for a price. All Component Availabilities count as one step rarer (Rare becomes Very Rare, for example). | +1 day | \n| Mining System | Hull repairs are usually easy to come by, and Explorers only have to make an Acquisition Test for every full ten points of Hull Integrity restored. | +1 day | \n| Naval Installation | All Components except Xenotech can be found, but only Rogue Traders with Peer or Good Reputation (Imperial Navy) may purchase Components at a Naval Installation. All Component Availabilities count as one step more common (Rare becomes Scarce, for example). Efficient workmen mean repairs only need 1 day for each 2 points of Hull Integrity restored. | -1 day | \n","excerpt":"# Upgrading and Installing New Components in Starships  An important aspect of owning a starship is improving and modifying it to suit the needs of its crew. This is done by retrofitting the vessel, a long, labour intensive, and time consuming process that often requires a full space-dock or forge world star-yard. It is also likely to be expensive, but can all pay off when marauding space-pirates feel the wrath of a freighter's concealed macro-cannons."},{"srdPath":"starships/void_hazards","title":"Void Hazards","content":"# Void Hazards\n\n## Hazards Onboard a Starship\n\nQuite a number of things can go wrong on a starship. Crippling blows from enemy guns can depressurize compartments, failing generators can plunge cabins into darkness, and a careless galley-steward can light entire decks ablaze. These problems have an adverse effect on the ship as well as unfortunate characters caught in them.\n\nA ship's Component is either intact, unpowered, damaged, or destroyed. Intact Components are fully functional, damaged Component are non-functional but can be repaired, and destroyed Components are nightmare mazes of twisted metal, raging infernos, and the bodies of the crew that once occupied them. Needless to say, a damaged Component cannot be used and will not provide any bonuses to the ship until it is repaired. A destroyed Component cannot be repaired, only replaced at a forge world or stardock.\n\nUnpowered Components have no gravity, no lights (besides emergency stablights), and any powered hatches and the like will not operate. A damaged Component is unpowered, but also contains other hazards, such as shorting electrical lines, ruptured bulkheads, and leaking pipes and air-lines. These can also create noxious vapors and, combined with failing air-purifier, mean that character in the Component without a breathing aid such as a gas mask will suffer from suffocation. Other environmental effects may exist in a damaged Component as well.\n\nDestroyed Components are extremely hazardous, with nothing more than twisted, jagged metal shards, live electrical lines, no air, or raging fires. In game terms, the Component is considered to no longer exist, though the GM is free to invent a suitably nightmarish environment for any character who must enter the space the Component used to occupy.\n\nComponents may also have hazards present on them that may be mildly inconvenient, or are a danger to any characters exposed to them and possibly the entire ship.\n\n### Depressurisation \n\nIf a Component is depressurised, the air violently vents over a number of Rounds (the GM should determine a time depending on how big the hole-was it a micro-meteor or a lance strike?). Any characters attempting to exit the Component treat it as Difficult Terrain as they battle high winds within the compartment. Once all air has vented, all characters inside the Component suffer the effects of vacuum. It is assumed airtight hatches will keep depressurisation confined to a single Component.\n\nDepressurisation deals 1d10 damage to Crew Population, and 1d5 damage to Crew Morale, but does not make the Component Damaged (although a depressurised Component may be damaged for other reasons, and vice-versa). The Component may even be used, provided the crewmembers wear void-suits. Depressurisation may be repaired by patching the hull, although the effects of vacuum on little details like the plumbing may linger for quite a while.\n\n### Fire \n\nIf a Component catches fire, it immediately deals 1d5 damage to Crew Population and 1d10 damage to Crew Morale (few things are as horrifying as a shipboard fire) and spreads through the entire Component (the GM should determine how long this takes, but it should be within 30 minutes or one Strategic Turn). Anyone occupying the Component is exposed to fire and suffers all of the appropriate adverse effects. If the fire is not brought under control in one Strategic Turn, it consumes the Component (it now counts as damaged), and moves on. The GM selects a new Component, and treats it as catching fire (including the Crew Population and Morale damage). The GM should randomly select the new Component from among what he determines are a set of logical options-it is more likely a fire would spread from the plasma drives to the warp engines than to the prow weaponry.\n\nTo put out a fire, a character must organise a firefighting team of crew and make a Difficult (-10) Command Test. This counts as an Extended Action and therefore may only be attempted once per Strategic Turn. However, multiple characters may organise firefighting teams and attempt to put the fire out, and only one needs succeed. Alternatively, the ship's captain can choose to vent the burning compartments into the void. If he does so, the fire is immediately extinguished. However, the burning Component now counts as depressurised. Instead of the normal damage to Crew Population and Morale, the ship suffers only 1d5 Crew Population damage (most of the Crew already fled the Component) but 2d10 Morale damage (nobody likes seeing their comrades vented into the void deliberately).\n\nNeedless to say, if every Component is consumed by fire, the ship is reduced to a burned-out hulk and counts as destroyed.\n\n### Zero Gravity \n\nFew forces are more essential to the everyday lives of humanity, yet gravity is something most take for granted. Those aboard starships do not have that luxury. Humanity developed the grav-plate during the mystical Dark Age of Technology, allowing them to simulate the effects of gravity in the chambers and passageways of their starships. However, these systems are fickle. Poor maintenance or battle damage can shut grav-plates off at inopportune times, leaving crewmembers stranded and drifting in mid-air. Additionally, if someone is forced to exit a ship and step into the blackness of the void, he will leave the effects of the grav-plates behind. It is imperative that every able-bodied void-man knows how to handle himself in such situations.\n\nZero gravity is considered Difficult Terrain, meaning that the movement of characters is halved while in it, and if they attempt to charge or run, they must succeed with a Hard (-20) Agility Test or drift out of control (treat as falling prone). Certain factors may mitigate this-a Void Born character, for example, does not treat zero gravity as Difficult Terrain and therefore ignores the above penalties. Additionally, a character beginning a movement action in zero gravity must be adjacent to a floor, wall, ceiling, or other secure object, so he has something to push off from.\n\n## Hazards Outside the Ship\n\nEnemy vessels are only one hazard a starship may encounter in its travels. Asteroid fields, gravity tides, ice rings, and nebula are all potential threats to be avoided-or in some cases, exploited.\n\n### Asteroid Field \n\nThe shattered remains of planets or the leftover debris from stellar nurseries, asteroid fields are vast expanses of drifting rock. A successful Routine (+10) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test is required to navigate an asteroid field. Success means the ship passes through the asteroid field unharmed, but for every degree of failure errant chunks of space rock strike the ship, doing 1d5+1 damage. The damage is cumulative, so if there are four degrees of failure, the ship will take 4d5+4 damage, ignoring void shields. Any Tests using a ship's auger arrays within an asteroid field are made one step more difficult.\n\n### Gravity Tides \n\nThough planet-dwellers consider gravity a universal constant, experienced voidsmen know that it can be a harsh and fickle force. In systems with multiple stars or large gas giants, gravity can behave strangely-sometimes in seeming defiance to the laws of physics. The most feared phenomena are the gravitational rip-tides found near gas giants during the conjunction of their larger moons, or at the midpoints of binary star-systems. Most avoid them, but a skilled-or insane-helmsman may try and use the flux to his advantage. It takes a Hard (-20) Scrutiny+Detection Test to spot a gravitational rip-tide on the ship's auger arrays, and a Challenging (+0) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test to avoid one. If a helmsman chooses, however, he can pilot his ship into the tide's gravity well while making a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test. Success means the helmsman has built up enough speed for his vessel to \"shoot the rapids\"-using the speed generated by the tide's pull to shoot out the other side at tremendous velocity. For every degree of success, the GM should subtract a day from the travel time to the starship's destination. If the helmsman fails the test-or the starship fails to spot and avoid the tide-the ship takes 1d5 damage to its Hull Integrity ignoring armour or void shields, and must make a Hard (-20) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test to break free. If it fails it takes another 1d5 damage and must make another test. This continues until the ship escapes or is destroyed.\n\n### Ice Rings \n\nThe rings of gas giants are especially dangerous for ships, as they combine the aspects of an asteroid field and a nebula. To navigate them, a ship must make a Challenging (+0) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test and a Challenging (+0) Navigation (Stellar)+Detection Test. Failing the first test by two or more degrees means the ship has blundered upon a particularly large chunk of ice-it takes 3d10 damage ignoring void shields. Failing the second test means the ship is delayed by a day. Any Tests using a ship's auger arrays within an ice ring are made two steps more difficult\n\n### Minefields \n\nA minefield reacts to a vessel inside its boundaries by making a Scrutiny Test with a Skill of 40 with a +10 modifier for every full 20 Space the vessel has (the larger the ship, the more mines it activates). The mines suffer a -40 to the Test if the vessel is on Silent Running. If the mines detect a vessel, they strike it with 1d5+2 explosive hits, with this test being done each round the vessel is in the field. Each hit deals 1d10+2 damage, and the hits are combined as though from a macrobattery salvo. Armour and void shields protects against mines as normal.\n\nMines are too small to be located via normal Detection; an Active Augury Extended Action reveals any minefields in within 10 VUs but immediately causes 1d5 detonations if the vessel is already within a field.\n\nShips can attempt to navigate a minefield in the same manner as for an asteroid field, with a Hard (-10) Operate (Voidship)+Manoeuvrability Test instead of a Routine Test and each impact dealing 1d10+2 damage.\n\nMines can also be detonated remotely with a Challenging (+0) Tech-Use Test if the activating ship is no more than 10 VUs distant. This instantly causes all mines to explode, causing 1d10 hits to any vessel within 1 VU of the minefield and emptying the field, but revealing the activating vessel even if the test fails. If the Minelayer Bay contains unused mines and is Damaged, there is a 50% chance the bay is Destroyed. The vessel takes one Critical Hit; roll 1d10 to determine the result.\n\n### Nebulae \n\nA nebula is a vast, dense cloud of gas and dust drifting in space. A successful Difficult (-10) Navigation (Stellar)+Detection Test is required to pass through a nebula on a proper course. Success means the ship makes its way through the nebula quickly, but failure means the ship is delayed. For every degree of failure, the ship must spend an extra day getting to its destination. In addition, the maximum weapon range for ships in a nebula is limited by the nebula's density (roll 3d10 at the start of battle, this is the furthest that all ship's sensors and weapons will operate). A ship making a Silent Running Manoeuvre gains +30 to its Manoeuvre Tests. Any Tests using a ship's auger arrays within nebula are made three steps more difficult\n","excerpt":"# Void Hazards  ## Hazards Onboard a Starship"},{"srdPath":"subtlety","title":"Subtlety","content":"# Subtlety\n\nSubtlety represents how secretive or overt the Acolytes are in their behaviour as they prosecute an investigation. Subtlety ranges from 0-100 and can be used as the basis for a test, just like a characteristic. Unlike characteristics, there is a single Subtlety value for the warband of Acolytes, which the GM tracks in secret, so that the players never know exactly what their Subtlety score is. The higher the Acolytes' Subtlety is, the less their enemies and potential allies know of their actions. The more their Subtlety decreases, the more transparent their actions become and the more others know. \n\nInquisitors and their Acolytes take many different approaches to accomplish their duties, and a high Subtlety is not necessarily better. While many Inquisitors prefer to move unseen throughout the Imperium, the better to take their enemies by surprise, some operate openly, trusting in the populace's fear of the Inquisition to smoke out the heretics amongst them. High and low Subtlety both have benefits and drawbacks, depending on the situation and the Acolytes' methods.\n\n## Tracking Subtlety\n\nEach warband begins with a Subtlety of 50. During the game, the Acolytes' actions serve to increase and decrease the group's Subtlety. The more obvious and direct they are, the lower their Subtlety, while the more cautious and secretive, the higher the value. Subtlety is likely to change throughout the course of an investigation in response to the Acolytes' decisions and the vicissitudes of fate. Table: The Subtlety Track provides examples of the behaviour of a group at different Subtlety values.\n\n### The Subtlety Track\n\n| Subtlety | Example | \n|---|---|\n| 01–10 | The Acolytes wear ostentatious armour and outfits, emblazoned with icons of the Inquisition, and a trio of tiny, winged servitors trumpet the group's every entrance. The warband accomplishes most tasks by giving direct orders to others in the name of the Inquisition, loudly threatening any who would dare oppose them. |\n| 11–20 | The Acolytes rely on their reputations to accomplish their goals, openly wearing symbols of their affiliations and loyalties. When questioning suspects or the general populace, the Acolytes are blunt and direct, and ready to respond with violence should anyone attempt to flee or deceive them. |\n| 21–30 | When dealing with a suspected cultist, the Acolytes openly attack with the goal of subduing him for later interrogation. |\n| 31–40 | While refraining from invoking the name of the Inquisition, the Acolytes nonetheless favour the direct approach, and respond to violence in kind. The heavy weaponry they tote draws some attention, particularly from the local Enforcers. |\n| 41–50 | The Acolytes take no great pains to hide their weapons and armour, nor to conceal their business. However, neither do they draw extra attention to themselves or announce their true allegiance. |\n| 51–60 | When dealing with a suspected cultist, the Acolytes trail him, observing his behaviour from afar and asking around amongst his acquaintances. |\n| 61–70 | The Acolytes go to great lengths to keep their presence unknown to their enemies, and to avoid drawing the attention of local authorities. They do their best to avoid violent engagements, even involving the lower ranks of the heretics' organization. |\n| 71–80 | The Acolytes go undercover to conduct the investigation. Even before their arrival in-system, the Acolytes operate under thoroughly detailed false identities in order to infiltrate the heretics' ranks and bring them down from within. |\n| 81–90 | Surprise is amongst the Acolytes' primary weapons. They operate with great stealth, concealing their presence or identity until it is time to strike. |\n| 91–100 | The Acolytes are neither seen nor heard, or are so perfect in their disguises that none suspect their true nature. |\n\n## Effects of Subtlety\n\nSubtlety is a crucial concern for Acolytes who serve an Inquisitor, with a number of far-reaching effects, yet neither a low or high value is necessarily \"better,\" as both can be beneficial under different circumstances. Whether low or high, Subtlety mainly affects the game in two ways. First, Subtlety impacts the game narratively, affecting the reactions of NPCs, shaping what resources the Acolytes can access, and determining how much their enemies and allies know of their activities. Second, the group's Subtlety can modify certain tests, either lowering or raising the difficulty based on its current value and the purpose of the test in question. Some tasks are more easily accomplished if the Acolytes are unknown or effectively disguised, while others benefit from a general awareness of the Acolytes' activities.\n\n### Narrative Effects\n\nThe transparency or secrecy of the Acolytes' behaviour can have any number of effects on the narrative of a game. A group that acts too openly could betray their presence to the cult for which they are searching, allowing the heretics plentiful time to flee or prepare an ambush. Conversely, if the Acolytes are too subtle in their investigation, when the time comes, they could have extreme difficulty convincing local authorities of the seriousness of the threat or even the true power the Acolytes represent.\n\nWhen an encounter arises that depends significantly on how overt or subtle the Acolytes are, the GM makes a Subtlety test using the group's current value. If the test succeeds, the Acolytes are considered subtle for the purposes of the event or encounter, remaining hidden from the cult or unknown to the Enforcers, for instance. If the test fails, the Acolytes are overt; their actions are revealed to a cult, taverns begin to buzz about odd strangers in the area, or their reputation becomes known to local Enforcers.\n\nDepending on the potential consequences for the narrative, the GM can roll the Subtlety test when the Acolytes take a particular action, or only once the results become evident. For instance, if the Acolytes are attempting to disguise themselves as off-world scholars in order to investigate a guild suspected of trading in proscribed texts, the GM could roll a Subtlety test when they introduce themselves, in order to determine if the guilders have heard rumours of an Inquisitor's Acolytes in the area, or of unknown persons investigating their operations. The guilders might offer a round of vintage amasec to the Acolytes - but if the Subtlety test had failed, the amasec is perhaps laced with a poison, or they have alerted their henchmen to intercept the Acolytes.\n\nWhen to make a Subtlety test ultimately comes down to the GM's preference and instinct. As with other tests, a Subtlety test is only necessary if the outcome has an impact on the story. Through its effects on the narrative, Subtlety can provide great opportunities for roleplaying. If they are openly operating as Acolytes of an Inquisitor, even powerful and influential individuals are likely to show the utmost respect and deference (at least to their faces), while these same NPCs may respond to the Acolytes with disdain or outright contempt if their authority is unknown. Even in the case of an NPC offering the same services or information regardless of the Acolytes' Subtlety, the nature of their interaction may be very different. A barkeep serves drinks to the Acolytes and offers the latest gossip in either case, but if the warband is subtle, he may water down the drinks and make jests at the Acolytes' expense. If he knows who they are, however, he might behave in an overly obsequious manner while serving the best amasec in the house and refusing to accept payment, clearly revealing that what might have been a carefully crafted disguise is all for naught. The Acolytes can then either try to continue with the charade, or utilise their reputation to their advantage.\n\n### Subtlety Test Modifiers\n\nOften, the success of an Acolyte's actions depends on how secretive or overt the group has been earlier. Infiltrating the local underworld can be much more difficult if everyone is watching over their shoulders for signs of the Inquisition. When an Acolyte attempts a test and the outcome depends on how well-known the group is, the GM can choose to have the group's Subtlety modify the test. To do so, the GM first decides if the action the Acolyte is attempting benefits from overtness or from subtleness. \n\nThe following examples demonstrate tasks that benefit from subtlety and from overtness:\nExamples of tasks benefitted by Subtlety:\n* Employing the Disguise use of the Deceive skill to conceal an Acolyte's identity.\n* Using the Inquiry skill to ask around in the criminal underworld, or questioning other untrusting individuals.\n* Applying the Shadowing use of the Stealth skill to covertly follow a suspected cultist.\n* Exercising the Tracking use of the Survival skill to locate a suspected killer.\n\nExamples of tasks benefitted by Overtness:\n\n* Using the Charm skill to impress an Adeptus Arbites Judge.\n* Employing the Terrify use of the Command skill to stop a squad of Enforcers running from a xenos monstrosity.\n* Applying the Inquiry skill on Emperor-fearing citizens.\n* Exercising the Interrogation skill to pry information from a recalcitrant cultist.\n\nThe GM then rolls a test using the group's Subtlety. If the Subtlety test is successful, the Acolyte gains a +20 bonus to tests relevant to a task that benefits from subtlety, or a -20 penalty if the task benefits from overtness. Conversely, if the Subtlety test is failed, the Acolyte suffers a -20 penalty if the task benefits from subtlety, but a +20 bonus if the test benefits from overtness. Depending on the circumstances and nature of the task at hand, this modifier could apply to a single roll, or to a series of tests using different skills.\n\nOf course, not every test should be affected by Subtlety. Before making a Subtlety test in order to modify an Acolyte's skill use, the GM should consider if the target NPC could possibly be aware of the Acolytes, and if so, if it makes a significant difference. When used appropriately, this effect of Subtlety significantly reinforces the importance of the Acolytes' choices. It reminds players that each of their actions has consequences, and that the world responds to the decisions they make.\n\n## Conjunction Of Subtlety And Influence\n\nIn many ways, Subtlety and Influence are connected. While Influence represents, in part, how well-known each individual Acolyte's career and achievements are on a sector-wide level, Subtlety represents knowledge of the group's current activities and whereabouts on a local level. Generally, the effects of Subtlety are short-term, while Influence is long-lasting and more permanent. Influence changes more slowly and infrequently, with major changes happening over time, whereas Subtlety can fluctuate quite a bit within a relatively short period. Influence and Subtlety have different effects on the game and usually come into play in different situations. However, sometimes both Subtlety and Influence can be relevant to a single test or encounter. Similarly, there are ways in which Subtlety can affect Influence and vice versa. It is up to the GM to determine when Subtlety and Influence are both relevant, or when one impacts the other. \n\n### Subtlety And Change In Influence\n\nOftentimes, events that result in an increase or loss of Influence for an Acolyte occur in the midst of an investigation or assignment. An Acolyte can perform an impressive and monumental feat, but the boost to his reputation could be much less if only his closest companions know of it. Conversely, even an abysmal failure could do little to affect an Acolyte's reputation if no one can link him to the incident. When an Acolyte stands to gain or lose Influence, the GM can decide that the warband's current Subtlety has the potential to mitigate the change. If so, he makes a Subtlety test against the warband's current Subtlety. If the test succeeds, the GM reduces the amount of Influence gained or lost by 1 for every 2 degrees of success. A warband's Subtlety is temporary in comparison to an Acolyte's Influence; if the nature of the event is such that the Acolyte can be easily connected to it after the fact, the warband's current Subtlety should not have an impact.\n\n### Subtlety And Influence Tests\n\nEffective use of Influence requires an Acolyte to use his name and reputation. While it is possible to use Influence while remaining incognito, such as by dropping names or making vague threats, it is often more difficult. Similarly, if an Acolyte has been acting subtly, others may not believe him when he finally does reveal his true identity. When an Acolyte attempts to use his Influence whilst engaged in an investigation, the GM should determine if the group's Subtlety has any bearing on the attempt. If so, then the GM can make a Subtlety test to determine the modifier to the Acolyte's Influence test, just as for any other test the outcome of which depends on Subtlety\n\n## Gaining Subtlety\n\nAs already stated, a group's Subtlety is not fixed, and changes based on the Acolytes' actions. Unlike characteristics, Subtlety often fluctuates, and usually changes numerous times during the course of an adventure in response to the players' decisions and the course of action taken by the Acolytes. The Acolytes increase their Subtlety by acting in a manner that conceals their presence or misdirects their foes. By using stealth, guile, and generally maintaining a low profile, the Acolytes can ensure a high Subtlety value, and the effects - both beneficial and detrimental - that entails.\n\nWhen the Acolytes gain Subtlety is at the GM's discretion. Any time an Acolyte acts to conceal his presence or to provide misinformation about the group and its plans, the GM can choose to increase the group's Subtlety. While Acolytes sometimes act with the specific intent of increasing their Subtlety, it can also occur as a side effect of their actions. When deciding how to go about a task, the Acolytes must consider the potential ramifications for future encounters; concealing their presence and identities could prevent the local authorities from interfering with an investigation, but those same authorities might not believe the Acolytes' story if they catch them breaking into a corrupt noble's manse. There are many ways that a group's Subtlety might increase, such as the following examples:\n\n* **Deception:** Lies, disguises, and false identities can help to conceal the Acolytes' presence and wrong-foot their enemies. All too often, the Acolytes have little or no knowledge of their true opponents when beginning an investigation, and can gain an advantage by ensuring their enemies are no better off. As all Inquisitors know, information is power. When an Acolyte successfully accomplishes an act of deception, the GM may raise the group's Subtlety. The amount gained depends on the scale of the deception and who it is being deceived. If the target of the deception is crucial to the investigation, the group's Subtlety could increase quite a bit. If, on the other hand, the target is only tangentially related to the main thrust of the action, the effect should be fairly minimal. The GM may also wish to consider the personality and reputation of the NPC involved. If the person has a reputation for outrageous exaggerations and falsehoods, perhaps no one believes him when he starts ranting about Acolytes of the Inquisition visiting him.\n* **Stealth and Subterfuge:** Perhaps the best way to keep a low profile is to simply never be seen. When an Acolyte completes a relevant task while avoiding notice, the group's Subtlety could increase. Similarly, an action taken with the express purpose of concealing their presence also might increase it. As the Acolytes cover their tracks and generally act in such a way as to hide their activities, they can avoid tipping of their enemies. Setting up a base of operations in a forlorn and abandoned hab instead of a well-known inn, going about their business while wearing disguises, and even using psychic powers to conceal their presence from the minds of others are all possible ways Acolytes could increase their Subtlety.\n\nWhile the Acolytes' actions play a strong part in determining their Subtlety, any number of factors beyond their control can also contribute, such as the methods of communication available to their enemies and allies, or the tendency for the local citizenry to gossip. When the group's Subtlety increases, it does so by a random amount, which the GM determines in secret. Recall also that the GM secretly tracks Subtlety, and the value is always hidden from the players. Consequently, though the players know their Subtlety at the beginning of the game, as soon as events start to modify it, they can never be sure of the exact value. \n\nWhen the GM decides that something has occurred to raise the Acolytes' Subtlety, it usually increases by 1d5. For major accomplishments or pivotal events, however, the Acolytes may gain 1d10 Subtlety. In either case, the GM can add positive or negative modifiers to these rolls based on the circumstances and the actions of the Acolytes. For instance, an Acolyte securing lodgings for the group under a false name might gain 1d5-2 Subtlety, while conducting business under an assumed identity complete with a detailed cover story, thorough disguise, and carefully falsified documents might increase the group's Subtlety by 1d10+1\n\n## Losing Subtlety\n\nJust as the Acolytes' actions can increase Subtlety, so can they reduce it. When the Acolytes act in a way that reveals their presence or intentions, the GM can reduce Subtlety in much the same way that he raises it for their covert actions. It is difficult to maintain high Subtlety if the Acolytes conduct their investigation using direct confrontation, excessive requisitions, brandishing grandiose weaponry and armour, relying on their reputations and authority, and generally broadcasting their presence. Such tactics may be effective in the short term, but the Acolytes must be wary that they do not hinder their ultimate goals. When the Acolytes' behaviour calls attention to their presence, activities, or plans, the GM secretly lowers their Subtlety value by a random amount appropriate to the situation. The following examples illustrate some of the common actions that decrease Subtlety:\n\n* **Exercising Authority:** From the most primitive feral world to the most populous hive city, word of an Inquisitorial presence spreads swiftly. If the Acolytes use their connections to the Inquisition to open doors, loosen tongues, or detain suspects, it can quickly reveal their presence to the populace and their enemies, even if such uses of power were made in private. The amount of Subtlety lost due to exercising authority is affected by the trustworthiness and discretion of the people they reveal themselves to, as well as how public are the circumstances of the revealing event.\n* **Intimidation:** Whether threatening the wrath of the Emperor or just a bloody lip, intimidation tends to get an Acolyte noticed, whether or not the target knows who the Acolyte really is. The amount of Subtlety lost due to intimidation depends on factors such as the severity of the threat, the importance and reputation of the threatened party, and whether the Acolyte follows through, as well as anything else the GM deems relevant.\n* **Combat:** Any time the characters engage in conflict, their Subtlety may be reduced. Even if the Acolytes leave no direct witnesses and cannot be tied to the fight, dead bodies and collateral damage lead to people talking, which makes it more difficult to lay low. Again, this holds true whether the locals view the Acolytes as representatives of the Inquisition or merely as no-good outsiders. The amount by which the Acolytes' Subtlety is reduced depends on the scale of the conflict, as well as how likely any witnesses are to talk. The types of weapons the Acolytes use and their appropriateness to the environment might also contribute. A shoot-out with laspistols and stubbers in the underhive is unremarkable, but one with graviton guns and force swords is not When the Acolytes lose Subtlety, the amount lost is random, just as with increases to Subtlety. \n \nDepending on the importance and scope of the action, the Acolytes' Subtlety can decrease by either 1d5 or 1d10, modified at the GM's discretion. As the Acolytes engage in secretive and overt actions, their Subtlety fluctuates. Small steps taken to hide their presence can be undone when a fight breaks out. A warband loudly arriving in the name of the Inquisition, then soon fading into the shadows, might cause their enemies to wrongly believe the Acolytes have given up and moved on. Consequently, Subtlety is fluid and, to an extent, self-determining. As Acolytes operate overtly, it becomes more difficult for them to conceal future actions. Likewise, a group that has thus far behaved furtively or deceptively might have trouble getting noticed, even if they want to.\n\n## Determining Subtlety\n\nOne element that distinguishes Subtlety from the other characteristics and resources at the players' disposal is the fact that, once events have modified the group's starting Subtlety, they are not aware of its exact value. Players are usually aware when their Subtlety changes, and if it increases or decreases, but they do not know by what amount. In some cases, however, the GM can modify the warband's Subtlety without the players even realising it - for instance, if the Acolytes were unaware that an enemy had intercepted their vox transmissions. As events further modify their Subtlety, it becomes more and more difficult for the players to guess its current value. This reflects the uncertain nature of undercover or otherwise covert investigations, and it helps to reinforce an air of mystery and paranoia.\n\nHowever, while the Acolytes cannot be certain of exactly how well-known their presence is to enemies and potential allies, this information is nonetheless an important factor in many decisions. For instance, if the Acolytes are deciding whether to approach a cult's hideout stealthily or in force, it helps to know that the cult is expecting intruders and has heightened security. Acolytes can get a rough idea of how successful their efforts at going undetected have been by asking around, observing the populace, or monitoring enemy communications. In game terms, by taking actions such as these, players can obtain limited information from the GM regarding the group's current Subtlety.\n\n### Making The Attempt\n\nWhen attempting to determine their current Subtlety, the players must first decide what exactly the Acolytes are trying to discover, and how they are going about it. For instance, the Acolytes might wish to determine whether locals are gossiping about the new outsiders, or whether a crime lord knows that several of his lieutenants are recently amongst the dead after a shootout. Based on the Acolytes' planned actions, the GM decides on an appropriate skill test to determine the outcome. There are numerous ways the Acolytes can attempt to discover their Subtlety, but likely skills include Awareness or Inquiry. The following are examples of common methods Acolytes can employ in an attempt to discover their warband's Subtlety:\n\n* **Asking Around:** Often, the best way to determine how well known the group's activities are is to simply ask around. Acolytes must walk a fine line when pursuing such a course of action, however. If they are not careful, they could inadvertently draw attention to themselves through their questions; individuals whom the Acolytes question may have their curiosity piqued and begin making inquiries of their own. For this reason, Acolytes must keep their questions vague or general. This precaution, however, runs the risk of dredging up inaccurate information. This approach relies primarily on use of the Inquiry skill. \n* **Observation:** Acolytes can attempt to determine their Subtlety by observing others. This could range from making general examinations of the populace and eavesdropping on conversations, to trailing a suspected heretic to see if his behaviour gives anything away. This strategy poses less risk of backfiring, as the Acolytes do not become directly involved. By the same token, if the Acolytes select the wrong persons or locations to examine, they may find themselves spending a great deal of time with little payoff. This approach commonly calls for Awareness tests.\n* **Inspection:** Particularly on more advanced worlds, Acolytes can discern a good deal of information about the relative covertness of their activities by inspecting records and data. This approach covers everything from remotely infiltrating a data-net to examining records at the local Administratum officio. Accessing or understanding such information usually requires specialised skills and knowledge, for the Acolytes must often bypass security measures or decrypt coded information. As such, it calls on an eclectic group of skills such as Tech-Use, Security, or Linguistics.\n\nAttempts to determine Subtlety are not to be undertaken lightly. They require the Acolytes to distil information from a number of sources, which generally takes a considerable amount of time. Exactly how long it takes is at the GM's discretion, but should generally be the better part of a day, or longer. Additionally, the Acolytes must proceed cautiously, lest their efforts to verify the success of their covert attempts actually backfire and tip of their enemies to the warband's presence. Under many circumstances, Acolytes can choose to spend extra time on the attempt, or alternatively to complete it in less than the amount of time the GM states. Taking additional time on the attempt provides a bonus to the skill test, while rushing the attempt provides a penalty.\n\nUnless the GM determines otherwise, only a single Acolyte makes the skill test to determine Subtlety, although he can benefit from assistance from other Acolytes if circumstances warrant. Having too many Acolytes working to determine Subtlety can be counter-productive, making it impossible to get an accurate picture as the various efforts create a sort of \"echo chamber\" in which the Acolytes own inquiries get back around to them, giving a false impression that others are asking around regarding the Acolytes. As a rough guideline, Acolytes can attempt to determine their Subtlety in as little as half of the time that the GM quotes, but with a -30 penalty to relevant tests, while spending twice as long grants a +20 bonus. Normally, the Acolytes make a single skill test when attempting to determine Subtlety. Depending on the circumstances and the Acolytes' plan, however, the GM can require multiple skill tests, perhaps by different Acolytes. Additionally, the attempt might take place through several encounters. \n\nFor instance, if the Acolytes decide to examine the records at the local Sanctionary precinct to see what the local authorities know about the Acolytes' activities, they must first gain access to the records without being caught, which would defeat the purpose. This could include multiple encounters, as the Acolytes break into the precinct house, search for the proper documents, avoid a patrol, and attempt to escape undetected. In this way, determining Subtlety can become the focus for a night's play and make for an exciting adventure in its own right.\n\nThe Game Master secretly rolls skill tests to determine Subtlety, so that the players do not know the result. If the skill test is successful, the GM describes the results, narratively providing the players with some idea of their Subtlety. In addition, the GM reveals the group's current Subtlety bonus (the first digit of their Subtlety score)\n\n### The Risks Of Failure\n\nIf the skill test fails, the GM still provides a narrative description of the results. If the test fails with less than two degrees, the GM can, at his discretion, declare that the Acolytes' attempts are simply inconclusive. However, if the test results in two or more degrees of failure, the Acolytes' attempts garner misleading results, and the GM provides an inaccurate number for the group's Subtlety bonus. Just how misleading the results are depends on the number of degrees of failure and the specifics of the situation. \n\nThe number that the GM provides to the Acolytes is different from their actual Subtlety bonus by an amount equal to the degrees of failure scored on the test. The GM decides if the false result is higher or lower than the Acolytes' actual Subtlety bonus, corresponding to the narrative description he provides. There are many potential outcomes depending on what method the Acolytes used. Table: Subtlety Determination Examples provides some examples based on the result of the test and the circumstances. The GM should describe the results of a failed attempt in the same manner as a successful attempt, so that the players do not become suspicious. This lack of certainty for the players adds an exciting degree of tension to the game, and can make for some very dramatic turns if the Acolytes proceed based on a misunderstanding of the situation.\n\n### Subtlety Determination\n\n| Skill Test | Skill Test Result | | | |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| *The Acolytes are trying to…* | *3 Degrees of Failure:* | *1 Degree of Failure:* | *1 Degree of Success:* | *3 Degrees of Success:* |\n| Monitor suspected cultists of the Amethyst Hand to determine if the cult realises it is under investigation.

Subtlety ranges from 0-100 and can be used as the basis for a test, just like a characteristic. Unlike characteristics, there is a single Subtlety value for the warband of Acolytes, which the GM tracks in secret, so that the players never know exactly what their Subtlety score is. The higher the Acolytes' Subtlety is, the less their enemies and potential allies know of their actions. The more their Subtlety decreases, the more transparent their actions become and the more others know.

Instead they can call upon legions of fanatical servants and followers, each one enamoured of the champion and willing to spend their life for his cause. Characters are no different, and as they grow in power they can gather a following of creatures and warriors to their side to aid them in their rise to glory, using the strong backs and sharp blades of their underlings to advance their own interests, and even compel them to die in their stead should the need arise—as it so often does upon the path to glory.\n\nMinions are special followers which Characters can gain for themselves much as they might acquire a lasting reputation or a piece of valued equipment. Unlike the aid of friendly NPCs which may be fleeting and half-hearted (and still subject to the control of the GM) a Minion is under the direct control of the player just like his own character and though it might not always follow his orders to the letter it is as loyal as followers are likely to get. In time players can even gather a number of Minions for their Characters which bolsters his fighting abilities; grants him access to Skills, Talents, and Traits he might not have; and— most importantly—die for him should he so choose.\n\n## Creating Minions\n\nWhen a Character takes a Minion Talent (either Greater Minion, Minion, or Lesser Minion), they gain the service of a Minion. Minions do not spontaneously appear out of nowhere, of course, and a player needs to come up with a reason why his Character has acquired the Minion, usually worked out with the aid of the GM. This could be as simple as buying a slave from a feral world market or enticing a soldier away from his warlord with the promise of glory and coin, or as complex as making a lasting pact with a powerful organisation like a Chaos Space Marine Legion and gaining the \"assistance\" of one of their warriors. The GM may also offer a character a Minion as part of an adventure, should an NPC become tied to the PCs and wish to enter their service (in this case the character still needs to take the appropriate Minion Talent). However it occurs, Minions should be added to a character during downtime between adventures or game sessions; after all bonds of loyalty taking time to strengthen. Once a character has acquired a Minion a player can then create it using the rules below. There are no restrictions on what Characteristics, Skills, Talents or Traits a Minion can have beyond those imposed by being a Lesser, Normal or Greater Minion. The GM does however have final say over a Minion's abilities before it enters play. All Minions fall into three categories of ascending power:\n\n- Lesser (chosen using the Lesser Minion Talent)\n- Normal (chosen using the Minion Talent)\n- Greater (chosen using the Greater Minion Talent)\n\nWhich type of Minion it is determines the level of its characteristics and its access to Skills, Talents, and Traits. Apart from these factors, however, there are no other restrictions on the exact form a Minion may take and players are encourage to be inventive.\n\n### Characteristics\n\nAll Minions have a set of characteristics just like PCs and NPCs representing their various strengths and weaknesses. Minions have a pool of points which they can divide amongst their characteristics depending on their level of power. When creating a Minion divide up these points between Weapon Skill, Ballistic Skill, Strength, Toughness, Agility, Intelligence, Perception, Willpower and Fellowship. A Minion's characteristics cannot be less than 01 (i.e. players must put at last 1 point into each characteristic when creating them) and cannot be exceed a certain value as determined by the power level of the Minion. The only exception is Influence/Infamy, which cannot be bought for minions.\n\n- Lesser: The Minion has 100 points to spread among its characteristics with no one characteristic higher than 30.\n- Normal: The Minion has 175 points to spread among its characteristics with no one characteristic higher than 35.\n- Greater: The Minion has 250 points to spread among its characteristics with no one characteristic higher than 40.\n\n#### Random Characteristics\n\nThe default method of character creation requires players to determine the Characteristics of their Character by rolling a number of d10s and adding a modifier. Some players and GMs may prefer to use a similar method to determine the Characteristics of Minions, rather than the standard method of distributing points. Minions created under the method outlined above are likely to have relatively high values in two or three Characteristics deemed important to their main purpose, with minimal values for their other Characteristics. Some players may prefer a more \"organic\" method to determine a Minion's abilities. No matter how much a mercenary swordsman may neglect his mind in pursuit of his skill-at-arms, he is unlikely to have Intelligence 01—barring a very unfortunate mutation of the mind! In addition, the standard method of point-assignment works very well for players who have a firm idea of their Minion in mind, but some players may prefer to generate Characteristics randomly, which may provide inspiration. If the GM agrees (or insists), players may generate Minion Characteristics randomly, as shown below. \n\nThis method is likely to result in higher characteristics overall, but also in a more even, natural distribution. This is offset by the fact that players do not have the opportunity to \"optimise\" their Minions' Characteristics using this method. To generate Characteristics, roll 2d10 for each Characteristic, and add 10 to the result on each for Lesser Minions, 15 for Minions, and 20 for Greater Minions. Before rolling, the player can choose up to two Characteristics to roll 3d10, dropping the lowest instead. For each Characteristic that gains this bonus, the player must choose another Characteristic that must roll 3d10 and drop the highest.\n\n### Wounds and Movement\n\nA Minion's Wounds and its Movement rate are both derived from its characteristics (though they may be altered later by the selection of certain Talents and Traits). A Minion's Movement is based on its Agility Bonus, in the same way as a PC. A Minion's Wounds are equal to twice its Toughness Bonus.\n\n### Skills\n\nJust like their masters, Minions have access to a number of Skills, often at varying levels of mastery. The number and ranks of these Skills is dependent on the Minions level of power. GMs may also restrict access to certain Skills for Minions (such as Lore or Operate Skills) if there is no reasonable way the Minion could have learned them. Unless the GM states otherwise, all Minions start with one Linguistics Skill of the players' choice, allowing it to communicate.\n\n- Lesser: The Minion may choose 4 Skills at Rank 1.\n- Normal: The Minion may choose 6 ranks of Skills (either 6 different Skills or fewer Skills at higher ranks) with no one skill higher than Rank 2.\n- Greater: The Minion may choose 9 ranks of Skills (either 9 different Skills or fewer Skills at higher ranks) with no one skill higher than Rank 3.\n\n### Talents\n\nA Minion's abilities can be further enhanced by the addition of Talents giving it greater abilities with which to aid its master. Talents are a vital part of a Minion and like Traits really define its nature and whether it is a skilled orator, bookish scholar or expert assassin. The number and types of Talents a Minion can take is dependent on its level of power. When selecting Talents Minions must select their Talents following all the normal prerequisite rules, such as having the Psyker Trait for psychic Talents. GMs may also restrict access to certain Talents for Minions if it does not fit with their background. Finally, unless the GM specially determines otherwise, Minions cannot take any of the Minion Talents.\n\n- Lesser: The Minion may choose 5 Talents none of which can be greater than Tier 1.\n- Normal: The Minion may choose 7 Talents none of which can be greater than Tier 2.\n- Greater: The Minion may choose 11 Talents up to and including Tier 3.\n\n### Traits\n\nMore than anything else, Traits determine the true nature of a Minion and whether it is a ravening daemon, soulless machine or hulking beast. The number and types of Traits a Minion can take is dependent on the Minions level of power. Some Traits also have variable levels indicated by a number in parenthesis (X) denoting extra armour, multiple arms or similar things. When taking a trait the number of this variable depends on the power level of Minion as noted below and if a range of numbers is shown the player may choose a number from within that range. The only exception to this is the Unnatural Characteristic trait which may not have a variable number higher than the Minions associated characteristic bonus (in effect this trait may not more than double any one characteristic bonus). Minions which take the Daemonic trait also gain the Warp Instability trait. GMs may also restrict access to certain Traits for Minions if it does not fit with their background. In addition, if the Minion does not take the Size Trait, it is assumed to be Size (4), the size of an average human. (Note: that some of these Traits, denoted by '†', are unique to Minions and are found under Minion Traits).\n\n#### Lesser\n\nThe Minion may select up to 3 Traits from the following list: \n\nAmphibious, Amorphous, Auto-stabilised, Bestial, Blind, Brutal Charge (1-2), Burrower (1-5), Crawler, Hoverer (1-4), Machine (1-2), Multiple Arms (1-2), Natural Armour (1-4), Natural Weapons, Quadruped, Size (1-10), Sonar Sense, Soul-bound, Stampede, Sturdy, Toxic (1), Unnatural Senses, Fanatic†, Parasite†, Sycophant†.\n\n#### Normal\n\nThe Minion may select up to 5 Traits from the following list: \n\nAmphibious, Amorphous, Auto-stabilised, Bestial, Blind, Brutal Charge (1-3), Burrower (1-8), Crawler, Dark-sight, Deadly Natural Weapons, Fear (1), Hoverer (1-6), Machine (1-4), Multiple Arms (1-3), Natural Armour (1-6), Natural Weapons, Navigator, Psyker, Quadruped, Regeneration (1-2), Size (1-10), Sanctioned, Sonar Sense, Soul-bound, Stampede, Sturdy, Toxic (1-3), Undying, Unnatural Characteristic (1-3), Unnatural Senses, Fanatic†, Incorporeal, Monodevotant†, Mutant (1)†, Parasite†, Sycophant†.\n\n#### Greater\n\nThe Minion may select up to 7 Traits from the following list: \n\nAmphibious, Amorphous, Auto-stabilised, Bestial, Blind, Brutal Charge (1-4), Burrower (1-10), Crawler, Daemonic, Dark-sight, Deadly Natural Weapons, Fear (1-2), Flyer (1-6), From Beyond, Hoverer (1- 10), Machine (1-6), Multiple Arms (1-4), Natural Armour (1-8), Natural Weapons, Navigator, Psyker, Quadruped, Regeneration (1-4), Sanctioned, Size (1-10), Sonar Sense, Soul-bound, Stampede, Stuff of Nightmares, Sturdy, Toxic (1-4), Undying, Unnatural Characteristic (1-4), Unnatural Senses, Warp Weapons, Fanatic†, Incorporeal, Monodevotant†, Mutant (1-3)†, Parasite†, Phase (Counts as 2 trait selections), Sycophant†.\n\n#### Trading Traits\n\nSome variables may be improved further by sacrificing the number of Traits a Minion could normally take. Players may further improve the Machine, Burrower, Flyer, Hoverer, and Natural Armour Traits in this way. For every trait they do not take they may increase a variable of one of these Traits by 1.\n\nIn addition, players may elect to trade a Trait selection for an additional Skill or Talent selection, following any other restrictions for the Minion level.\n\n#### Psyker Minions\n\nMinions that select the Psyker Trait may select the following, in place of a Talent\n\n- New Psychic Power (Counts as Tier 1)\n- Increase Psy Rating (Counts as Tier 3)\n\n#### Navigator Minions\n\nMinions that select the Navigator Trait may select the following, in place of a Talent\n\n- New Navigator Power (Counts as Tier 1)\n- Improve Power to Adept (Counts as Tier 2)\n- Improve Power to Master (Counts as Tier 3)\n\n### Equipment\n\nThe arming and armouring of Minions is largely the responsibility of their masters and a favoured Minion is usually one with the best weapons and equipment. Minions do bring some gear with them when they join the service of the character as determined by their level of power. Minions may only take Common Craftsmanship equipment.\n\n- Lesser: The Minion may choose one suit of armour and one ranged weapon or one melee weapon with an Availability of Scarce or lower.\n- Normal: The Minion may choose one suit of armour and two ranged weapons or two melee weapons (or one melee and one ranged weapon) with an Availability of Rare or lower. They may forgo taking one weapon to take another with an Availability of Very Rare instead.\n- Greater: The Minion may choose one suit of armour with an Availability of Extremely Rare or lower (if power armour, it may only have one sub-system of the players' choice) and two ranged weapons and two melee weapons with an Availability of Very Rare or lower. They may forgo taking one weapon to take another with an Availability of Extremely Rare instead.\n\nPlayers may forgo taking one of their weapons or armour to take other equipment with an equivalent Availability instead. At the GM's discretion Minions may also come with backup weapons (of Common availability or lower) and other small items and gear such as clothing, drugs, or tech, provided it is neither expensive or difficult to find. Players cannot choose equipment for their character's Minions which the Minion cannot use itself, nor can Minions give up their equipment readily when they enter play. Once a Minion is in the service of a character they have only what he gives them from this point on.\n\n### Loyalty\n\nThe final aspect of creating a Minion is to determine its Loyalty. This is a measure of the Minion's devotion to the character and how readily it follows commands in their absence, or the lengths the Minion goes to in the character's name. A Minion's Loyalty is equal to the character's Fellowship. Whenever the character's Fellowship changes, for whatever reason, the Minion's Loyalty also changes.\n\n## Using Minions\n\nMinions differ from NPCs in that they are not controlled by the GM. Instead they are controlled by the player in the same way as his own character. In effect, a Minion represents an additional, weaker character run by the player, augmenting his abilities in the game and presenting him with different ways to overcome challenges. Minions are not, however, completely subservient to their character's will (even the most fanatical of followers are not completely infallible), and in certain situations may not do what the character wants (or they might just get it wrong). Whenever a player wants one of his character's Minions to either:\n\n- Risk their life (combat does not count provided the character is fighting alongside them)\n- Perform a task out of character (i.e., refrain from attacking a hated foe or from looting the dead)\n- Follow orders in their absence (i.e., left on guard duty or sent off to kill someone)\n\nThe GM makes a Loyalty Test for the Minion. The GM rolls 1d100 against the Minions Loyalty, if the roll is equal or less that its Loyalty then the Minion performs exactly as the player wishes, if the roll is greater than its Loyalty then its nerve has failed or something has gone wrong and the GM takes control of the Minion for the remainder of the encounter.\n\n### Improving Minions\n\nUnlike Heretics, Minions do not improve as the character gains experience, and are set at the level at which they entered play, based on the Talent taken to acquire them. With the GM's permission, however, players may upgrade their Minions by upgrading the Talent associated with them. For instance, a Lesser Minion, acquired with the Lesser Minion of Chaos Talent, could become a Normal Minion if the player took the Minion of Chaos Talent. In this case the old Talent is either discarded (and its experience goes toward the new Talent) or the character can acquire a new Minion for it. In both cases characters must still follow all the Normal prerequisites for acquiring Talents. When this occurs the player goes back through Minion creation with his Minion and adds Characteristic Points, Skills, Talents, Traits and gear to make up the difference between its current level and its new level. For instance a Lesser Minion which became a Normal Minion would have another 70 points to spend on characteristics and could raise characteristics up to 30.\n\n### Replacing Minions\n\nIt is likely that sooner or later a character's Minions are going to die (or he is going to grow bored with them and dismiss them from his service, possibly violently). When this happens the character does not lose the Talent used to gain the Minion. Instead he may create a new Minion to fill the slot left behind, in effect gaining a Minion for the Talent in the same manner as when he first took it. Replacing Minions is not an instant process, however, and unless there are exceptional circumstances, as determined by the GM (such as a loyal allied NPC already with the group and eager to serve), it can only take place in downtime between adventures (i.e., at some point the character would be able to go off and find a new Minion). Replacement Minions follow all the normal rules for Minions and are created in the same way and are subject to GM approval.\n\n## Horde Minions\n\nA Character with the Horde Minion Talent can create a Horde Minion. Horde Minions are created in the same manner as Lesser Minions, either using the standard method or the alternative random characteristics method Rather than generating a Wounds value, however, the Minion is given a Magnitude equal to one half of the Character's Influence. This represents the higher numbers of followers that an especially influential Character can attract, and possibly the higher quality attracted, as well. Though a Horde represents a number of individuals, it is treated in game terms as a single character, and likewise counts as a single Minion toward the Character's limit. If a Character's Influence changes during the course of a session, the Magnitude of his Horde Minion is adjusted to reflect the change, subject to the GM's discretion. An increase in Influence and corresponding increase in Magnitude does not necessarily represent additional individuals joining the Horde, though it certainly could if the Characters are in a populated area. It could just as readily represent an increase in the morale of the Character's followers, or even a blessing from the gods. If the GM determines an immediate change would be inappropriate for the circumstances, he may wish to defer the adjustment to Magnitude until a fitting opportunity, such as when the Characters return to their base of operations to gather more servants, or stage a ritual to bind additional souls to the Character's will, or simply until the end of the session. Horde Minions follow all the rules for Hordes, but additionally require certain considerations that do not typically apply to Minions. For instance, should the Characters procure a ride on a shuttlecraft with a capacity for a dozen or so passengers, it may be hard to fit a Magnitude 35 Horde of bloodthirsty cultists. Likewise, it may prove extremely difficult to covertly infiltrate an Imperial settlement with a pack of vicious xenos beasts in tow. Players and GMs should therefor consider these potential complications when introducing Horde Minions into a campaign. In the case of Hordes consisting of sentient beings, it is a good idea to nominate either a leader or representative member of the Horde to act as its \"face\" when interacting with characters or accepting orders from the Character. This representative member of the Horde may have a distinct personality and appearance, but is not treated as a separate character. Typically, this individual is assumed to survive any damage to the Horde's Magnitude, though that does not preclude non-fatal injuries.\n\n### Horde Minions and Damage\n\nA Horde's Magnitude is an abstraction of its durability and power, including factors such as the number of individuals, their morale and training, and their capacity to endure injury. Consequently, the reduction of a Horde's Magnitude due to damage sustained in combat does not represent the deaths of individuals on a one-for-one basis, but rather the reduction of the Horde's ability due to injuries, fatalities, and loss of morale. Due to the abstract nature of Magnitude damage, Horde Minions \"heal\" in a very different way to normal characters. In the aftermath of a fight, characters can attempt to restore a Horde's Magnitude in two ways, as both the bodies and spirit of the Horde can be treated. Once one of these methods has been successfully used to restore one or more points of Magnitude, it cannot be used again until the Horde's Magnitude has been changed through some other manner, such as further damage or the introduction of new members. Regardless of the methods used, a Horde's Magnitude cannot be raised above its normal value. A character with the Medicae Skill may perform first aid on the injured members of the Horde. Because this requires the treatment of numerous individuals, the time required for the Test must be left to the GM's discretion. However, it generally should take no less than one minute, and is simply too involved a process to be completed in the midst of combat. The character makes a Challenging (+0) Medicae Test. A successful Test restores Magnitude equal to the character's Intelligence Bonus, +1 for every two Degrees of Success. Unlike physical injuries, the morale and spirit of the Horde can only be significantly improved through the actions of the owning Character. The Horde's master attempts a Challenging (+0) Command, Charm, Deceive, or Intimidate Test. A successful Test restores an amount of Magnitude equal to the character's Influence Bonus, +1 for every Degree of Success, up to the Horde's starting Magnitude. This represents the Character rallying the troops with hymns, offering sweet inducements, cracking a whip menacingly, or convincing them that things are not as bad as they look. Hordes do not recover Magnitude over time in the way characters heal Damage. However, a Horde's Magnitude is restored during appropriate periods of downtime, in much the same way as an increase in Magnitude due to a rise in the Character's Influence.\n\n## Superior Minions\n\nMinions, typically, are a cut above the assorted hirelings, mercenaries, and servants whom a Character may enlist. Nevertheless, Minions have their limitations, notably the fact that they cannot improve their abilities past the levels permitted by the Greater Minion Talent. Eventually, even a Greater Minion may outlive its utility as a Character grows in power, for the greatest servants of Chaos are nothing if not fickle masters. The Superior Minion Talent grants the Character a powerful Minion whose abilities can improve over time, reflecting the Character's own advancement. A Superior Minion may represent a particularly skilled or favoured servant, a dangerous ally, or even an almost-trusted partner. Unlike other Minions, Superior Minions can improve their Characteristics, Skills, and Talents. Superior Minions are unique in that they can obtain and spend Experience Points in much the same way as Characters. When a player first selects the Superior Minion Talent, he creates the Superior Minion following the same process as if he were creating a Greater Minion. A Superior Minion counts toward the limit on the number of Minions the Character can have. Unlike other Minion Talents, the Superior Minion Talent cannot be taken multiple times; a Character may only have a single Superior Minion at a time. Superior Minions have a Loyalty value just as other Minions, which is tested against under the same circumstances. As powerful as they may be, Superior Minions follow all the normal rules for Minions, with the exceptions noted below. Each time the Character gains the Minion Improvement Talent, when creating the Superior Minion or at a later time, his Superior Minion gains 500 xp to spend. A Superior Minion's xp total may never exceed 50% of the controlling Character's xp; any excess Experience Points, from any source, are lost.\n\n### Advancing Superior Minions\n\nSuperior Minions generally gain xp when a Character purchases the Minion Improvement Talent, and perhaps as a reward for game play. Regardless of the source, Minions may spend xp in the same manner as Characters, with a few clarifications and additional limitations. Like Characters, Superior Minions may purchase Characteristic Advancements at the Simple, Intermediate, Trained, and Expert levels, as well as Skills and Talents. Also like Characters, the Experience cost for an Advancement is determined by the Minion's Alignment and that of the Characteristic, Skill, or Talent in question.\n\n#### Superior Minions and Alignment\n\nWhen created, a Superior Minion's Alignment is the same as the controlling Character; e.g., an Unaligned Character's Superior Minion is Unaligned. Any time a Character checks his Alignment (usually after gaining 10 Corruption Points), the Superior Minion must also check its Alignment. If the Superior Minion's Alignment changes to that of a god only Allied to the Character's own patron (excluding Unaligned), the Character reduces his Influence by 1d5, representing a loss of face in the eyes of his god's other followers, and perhaps the god itself. If the Superior Minion's Alignment changes to that of an Opposed god, the Minion leaves the Character's service and the Character reduces his Influence by 1d5+5. The specifics of how the Minion departs are up to the GM, and could range from stealing a vehicle in the dark of night to making an attempt on the Character's life. Tracking down and taking revenge on a treacherous former Minion could form the basis for an adventure, or even a Compact, allowing the Character to regain some of the Influence he lost in the first place! Normally, Skills and Talents selected when a Superior Minion is created do not count towards Alignment. With the GM's permission, however, a player may choose for his Minion's starting Talents and Skills to count toward Alignment, in which case the decision must be made when the Minion is created and all Skill and Talents thereafter count towards Alignment. This option cannot be chosen if the Minion's Skills and Talents would result in it being Aligned to a god Opposed to the Character's own. Certain Superior Minions are, by their very nature, bound to a particular Chaos god, as is the case with Daemons. When created, the GM may deem that a Superior Minion is permanently Aligned to a specific Chaos god, or permanently Unaligned. In this case, the Minion's Alignment cannot be Opposed to the Character's, and will always determine the xp cost for Advancements. Such a Minion cannot purchase an Advancement Aligned to another god if it would surpass the number of Advancements Aligned to its own patron.\n\n#### Marks of Chaos\n\nWith the GM's permission, a Superior Minion who meets the requirements (20 Advances along a single path of Devotion) may be eligible to receive a Mark of Chaos, with all the benefits entailed. Unlike Characters, the Mark of Chaos is not free, and the Minion must spend 500 xp to obtain it.\n\n### Replacing Superior Minions\n\nAs is the case with other Minions, a Character may replace a Superior Minion who has been killed or otherwise left the Character's service at an appropriate point, such as the downtime between adventures; although when dealing with such an important Minion, GMs and players may wish to incorporate the introduction of the Superior Minion into play, or even as a focal point of a session. When creating a replacement Superior Minion, the Minion has an amount of xp available to spend based on the value of the Character's Minion Improvement Talent, if he has selected it more than once. To lose a Superior Minion represents a major blow to a Character's resources, and a potential opportunity for his enemies. Should a Superior Minion die in combat or otherwise perish in the course of his service to the Character, the Character loses 1d5 Influence.

Instead they can call upon legions of fanatical servants and followers, each one enamoured of the champion and willing to spend their life for his cause.

This ability is evinced by certain xenos creatures for which it is a necessity of their life cycle, but it might also be evinced by bizarre cyber-constructs of Forge Castir, or even stranger entities. Usually, a parasitic creature is much smaller than potential host organisms, no more than Size (2). Depending on the nature and size of a particular Minion, the GM may deem it necessary to modify this Trait to better reflect the functions of a specific creature. In order to attach itself to, or enter the body of, a host, known as infection, the parasite must come into physical contact. Infecting the host organism takes 1d5 Rounds, +1 for each Armour Point on the location through which the parasite is attempting to enter, to represent either the Minion burrowing through armour or searching for a weak point or opening. If the intended host is aware of the parasite at any point during this process, he may attempt to stop it, most likely by either attacking it or pulling it off. Any successful attacks against the parasite, by the potential host, or by another character, inflict half Damage against the host, and any attacks that fail by one degree or less strike the host instead. The parasite can be pulled free before it has fully attached to or entered the host, with an Opposed Strength Test. If the parasite fails, it is removed from the host, who suffers 1d5 Damage, not reduced by Toughness Bonus. Once infected, the host must pass a Hard (-20) Toughness Test or succumb to the parasite's influence, which may range from subtle changes to behaviour to outright control, depending on the nature of the parasite. Infection is insidious, and the parasite must be removed, probably with the aid of a chirurgeon or flesh adept, before the host's behaviour can return to normal.\"},{\"trait\":\"Sycophant\",\"id\":\"sycophant\",\"description\":\"This Minion has an innate tendency to latch on to more powerful individuals and is loyal almost to the point of absurdity. Minions with this trait are likely to perceive every word from their master's mouth as divinely inspired wisdom, and his every act as pure genius. Heretics of a particularly vain nature are likely to appreciate this behaviour, while others may find it infuriating. Nevertheless, the commitment these Minions show is beyond question. A Minion with the Sycophant Trait increases its Loyalty by +15. In addition, such is the sycophantic Minion's lavish and unceasing praise of its master, that the Heretic removes Fellowship Damage at twice the normal rate.\"}]","excerpt":"# Minion Traits"}]
